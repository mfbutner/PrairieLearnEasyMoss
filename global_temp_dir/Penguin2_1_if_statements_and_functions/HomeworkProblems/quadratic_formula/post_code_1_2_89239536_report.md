# Real Roots of the Quadratic Equation

###1. Accept values of the user.
    ..1.accept a value of quadratic function 
    ..2. accept b value of quadratic function   
    ..3. accept c value of quadratic function

   
###2. Number of roots
    ..1 find the descriminant    
    ..2. on the condition that the discriminant is greater than 0, we can expect two real solutions.
    ..3. on the condition that  the discrimant is equal to 0, we can expect one real solution.
    ..4. one the condition that the discrimant is less than 0, we can expect no real solutions
###3. Solving 
    1. take the values and put them into the quadratic formula.
###4. output
    1. tell the user whether or not the solutions are real.
    2. tell the user what  the roots are on the condition that they are real.

# Differences
- I added more description to the imput demanded by the user to be more specific on what could be accepted by the program
- I included a step for finding the descriminant and what to do with that value.

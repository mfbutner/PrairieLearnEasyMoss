# Real Roots of the Quadratic Equation

###1. Accept values of the user.

###2. Decide whether or not the value is real
    1. if the value is real: continue.
    2. if the value is not real then skip to step 5.
    
###3. Number of roots
    1. on the condition that the discriminant is greater than 0, we can expect two real solutions.
    2. on the condition that  the discrimant is equal to 0, we can expect one real solution.
    
###4. Solving 
    1. take the values and put them into the quadratic formula.
###5. output
    1. tell the user whether or not the solutions are real.
    2. tell the user what  the roots are on the condition that they are real.

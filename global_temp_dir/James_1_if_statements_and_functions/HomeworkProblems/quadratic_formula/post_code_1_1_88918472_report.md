# Algorithm (steps to solve the problem)
## Steps
1. Create functions to solve for root of quadratic equations
2. Get user inputs for a,b,c
3. Give user outputs for roots

## Create functions to solve root of quadratic equations
1. Create a function that uses quadratic formula for the + sign
2. Create a function that uses quadratic formula for the - sign

## Get user inputs for a,b,c
1. Ask user for the value of a
2. Ask user for the value of b
3. Ask user for the value of c

## Give user outputs for roots
1. Get both roots for the + and - formulas for the quadratic equation
2. Check if both roots are equal
3. Check if roots are real numbers
4. Out of if there are none, one, or two solutions with the correct solutions


# Differences
1. I did not plan on creating functions for the quadratic formula
2. I did not have a step to check if both roots could be equal to each other
3. I did not have a step to check if the roots were real numbers

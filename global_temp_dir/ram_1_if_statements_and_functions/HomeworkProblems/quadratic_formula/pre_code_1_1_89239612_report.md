# My Algorithm (steps to solve the problem)
##Execute Quadratic Formula 
1. Setup the equation
2. Solve the discrimenent 
3. determine the solution value
4. display solution values

##Setup the equation
1. Display the quadratic formula equation
2. Gather the user input 
3. start by gathering the a-value then b-value then c-value

##Solve the discriminent
1. setup discrimenent equation and solve with given user values
2. if the discriminent equals to 0 then there is one solution
3. if the discriminent equals to a value greater then 0 there is two solution
4. if the discriminent equals to less then 0 there is no solution


##Determine solution value
1. with the same given user values
2. Setup the math equation needed to result in the positive solution 
3. Setup the math equation needed to result in the negative solution

##display solution values
1. if discrimenent equals to 0 then both solutions should be the same value (display either one)
2. if discrimenet equals to a value greater than 0 (display both positive and negative solutions)
3. if discrimenet equals to a value less than 0 (display no values as none exist)

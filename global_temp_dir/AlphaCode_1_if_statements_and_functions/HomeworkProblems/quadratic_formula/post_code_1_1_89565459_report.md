# Algorithm (steps to solve the problem)

##Process
1. Ask the user for a quadtratic equation in the form of ax^2 + bx + c
2. Tell user if there are real solutions (if any)
## Asking the user for the quadtratic equation 
1. ask the user for an a to fit in ax^2
2. ask the user for a b to fit in bx
3. ask the user for a c to fit in + c
##After asking the user for a b and c, caclulate the discriminant
1. The discriminant is b^2 -4ac
2. plug in the users b for b and the users a for a and the users c for c
3. The number you got is called the discriminant 

##After evaluating the discrimiant
1. Check if the discriminant is equal to zero, if it is there is one real solution. If it is not move to the next step
2. Check if the discriminant is greater than zero. If it is there exists two real solutions. If not then there are no real solutions
##If there are real solutions:
1. You will use the quadratic formula to find these solutions

## How to use the quadratic formula

1. The quadratic formula is (-b + or - the square root of the discriminant) all over 2 times a
2. Plug in the users a b and discriminant in the quadratic formula, try it two times. Once with subrtacting -b from the discriminant and the other adding -b to the discriminant
3. You will get either one or two answers

##What to do with the answer(s)

1. You will name the answer(s) solution. If you had two answers it will be solution 1 and solution 2. But if you have just one answer it will be called solution 1.

##Last step
1. Now tell the user if the equation has real solutions or not.
2. If it doesnt have real solutions just tell him that his equation has no real solutions
3. If it has real solutions, the solution will be the solution(s) we have found in the previous step. Display the positive one first and the negative one second if applicable. If not applicable just display both answers
# Differences
######. I checked if the solution is equal to zero first before checking for other possibilities 
######. Other than that there exists no differences.

# My Algorithm (steps to solve the problem)

## Process
1. Ask the user for a quadtratic equation in the form of ax^2 + bx + c
2. Tell user if there are real solutions (if any)

## Asking the user for the quadtratic equation 
1. ask the user for an a to fit in ax^2
2. ask the user for a b to fit in bx
3. ask the user for a c to fit in + c

##After asking the user for a b and c, caclulate the discriminant
1. The discriminant is b^2 -4ac
2. plug in the users b for b and the users a for a and the users c for c
3. The number you got is called the discriminant 

##After evaluating the discrimiant
1. Check if the discriminant is greater or equal to zero
2. If it is not greater than or equal to zero, there are no real solutions
3. If it is greater than or equal to zero, there are real number solutions 

##If there are real solutions:
1. You will use the quadratic formula to find these solutions

## How to use the quadratic formula

1. The quadratic formula is (-b + or - the square root of the discriminant) all over 2 times a
2. Plug in the users a b and discriminant in the quadratic formula, try it two times. Once with subrtacting -b from the discriminant and the other adding -b to the discriminant
3. You will get either one or two answers

##What to do with the answer(s)

1. You will name the answer(s) x. If you had two answers it will be x1 and x2. But if you have just one answer it will be called x

##Last step

1. Now tell the user if the equation has real solutions or not.
2. If it doesnt have real soltuions just tell him that his equation has no real solutions
3. If it has real solutions, the solution will be the x or xs we have found in the previous step. Display the positive one first and the negative one second if applicable. If not applicable just display both answers

# Algorithm (steps to solve the problem)

## Declare Parameters
1. Specify that the format of a quadratic equation is a*x^2 + b * x + c.
2. Find the respective values of a, b, and c of a quadratic equation.

## Determine if there are any soltuions
1. If the discriminate of a quadratic formula is less than 0, there are no real solutions.
2. If the discriminate is larger than or equal to 0, there are solution(s).

## Find Solutions (if there are any)
1. Use the formula for solving quadratic equations, with the parameters a, b, and c.
2. Solve the square root part of the formula.
3. Solve the denominator part of the formula.
4. Find out if the square root of the discriminate is equal to 0 or greater.
5. If it is equal to zero, there is only one soltuion.
6. That solution is equal to -b / the denominator, since the square root part of the formula is equal to 0.
7. If the square root of the discriminate is greater than 0, there are two solutions.
8. The first solution is equal to -b + the square root part of the fomula, all divided by the denominator part.
9. The second soltuion is equal to -b - the square root part of the fomula, all divided by the denominator part.

## Declare Answers
1. If there are no soltuions, then claim there are no solutions.
2. If there is one soltuion, explain that there is one and declare what that soltuion is.
3. If there are two solutions, explain that there are two and what each one is.

# Differences
- The integration of setup of the equation into the solving of the solution. Before I had a seperate section for the setup of the quadratic formula for solving equations, but I ended up integrating it into the solution section. I felt that it was more intuitive and simple to include it while solving the equation.
- The seperate section for determining whether there are any solutions at all. I came to realize that it was easier and simpler to determine whether there were any possible real soltuions, because if there were not any, then there was no reason to use the quadratic formula at all.

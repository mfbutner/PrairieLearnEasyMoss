# My Algorithm (steps to solve the problem)

## Declare Parameters
1. Specify that the equation is in the form ax^2 + bx + c.
2. Ask user for numbers belonging to a quadratic equation represented as a,b, and c.
## Setup Equation
1. Use the quadratic formula for solving quadratic equations.
2. Use the formula to determine which numbers belong where in the formula.
## Sove Equation
1. Evaluate all parts of the setup equation.
    - Evaluate the parts within the square root first.
    - Then evaluate the part of the numerator outside the square root.
    - Then evaluate the part in the denominator and divide the numerator by it.
2. Then evaluate for both possible answers and determine if there are one, two, or zero solutions.
## Declare Answer
1. Say wether there were any solutions and what those soltions were.

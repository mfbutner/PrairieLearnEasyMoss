# Algorithm (steps to solve the problem)

##Input
1. Get user input for a,b and c for ax^2+bx+c 
##Checking for Different Solutions
1. Check that the numbers are real numbers, and if not say that there is an invalid input
2. Check if (b^2-4ac) is negative and if so there is no solution/x intercepts
3. Check if (b^2-4ac) is zero and if so say that there is only one solution  
4. Anything else will have two solutions  
##Calculations
1. If there are no solutions do not calculate anything.
2. But if there is one solution calculate only (-b)/(2a)
3. If there are two solutions calculate the result of the equation (-b+sqrt((b^2)-(4ac)))/(2a) and (-b+sqrt((b^2)-(4ac)))/(2a) 
## Display 
1. If there is no solutions then the answer is no solutions
2. If there is one solution the answer is the one solution calculated
3. If there are two solutions it will be the two calculated.
# Differences
1. I added extra parenthases to make sure that the caculations are correct.

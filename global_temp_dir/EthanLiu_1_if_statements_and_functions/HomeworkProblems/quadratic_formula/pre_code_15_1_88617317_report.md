# My Algorithm (steps to solve the problem)
##Input
- Get user input for a,b and c for ax^2+bx+c 
##Checking for Different Solutions
- Check that the numbers are real numbers, and if not say that there is an invalid input
- Check if (b^2-4ac) is negative and if so there is no solution/x intercepts
- Check if (b^2-4ac) is zero and if so say that there is only one solution  
- Anything else will have two solutions  
##Calculations
- If there are no solutions do not calculate anything.
- But if there is one solution calculate only (-b)/2a
- If there are two solutions calculate the result of the equation (-b+sqrt(b^2-4ac))/2a and (-b+sqrt(b^2-4ac))/2a 
## Display 
- If there is no solutions then the answer is no solutions
- IF there is one solution the answer is the one solution calculated
- If there are two solutions it will be the two calculated.

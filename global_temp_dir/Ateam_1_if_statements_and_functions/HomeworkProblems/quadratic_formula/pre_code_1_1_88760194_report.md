# Quadratic Equation Solver

##Ask the user for their inputs
- Scan A, B, and C, store them in variables

##Check if Solutions Exist
1. Check if b^2 - 4ac is a negative number
2. If it is, then return false, if it is not then return true
##Quadratic Formula Calculations
1. If solutions exist, perform the following calculations
1. Evaluate (-b+sqrt(b^2-4ac))/2a and store it in a variable
2. Evaluate (-b-sqrt(b^2-4ac))/2a and store it in a separate variable
##Print results
1. If solutions dont exist print "There are no real solutions"
2. If solutions equal eachother print "There is one real solution: " With the solution found
3. If solutions are both different print the solutions

# Algorithm (steps to solve the problem)
1.I come up with a method in prior with the formula in the prompt b^2-4ac
2.I come up with a second method to calculate the root(s) value by using the given constants a,b,c.
3.I first determine the value of b^2-4ac using the first method mentioned above to to help me determine the number of roots for the quadratic function.
    1.if it ends up having only one solution, calculate the value using the second method, present it and end.
    2.if it has no solution, state it and end.
    3.if it has 2 solutions, calculate 2 values using the second function,present 2 of them in increasing order and end.

# Differences
1.I put the calculating methods in the very beginning. Except that, nothing is different from my original solution.

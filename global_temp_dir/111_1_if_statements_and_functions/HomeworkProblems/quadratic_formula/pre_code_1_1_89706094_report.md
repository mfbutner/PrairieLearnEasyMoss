# My Algorithm (steps to solve the problem)
1.The purpose of this problem is to analyze the given function, determine the numbers of the roots it has and give the ultimate answer(s).
##Analyze the function
1.I will firstly ask for the coefficient value to get the quadratic function
2.I will then rely on the formula given in prompt to determine the numbers of the roots
##Determine the roots numbers and give the ultimate answer(s)
1.Based on the value of b^2-4ac, I can tell that if it's equal to zero, then there are only 1 result possible 1.Calculate the result and end.
2.If it's greater than zero
    1.Calculate 2 results respectively and end.
3.If it's less than zero.
    1.State that there are no roots for this quadratic function and end.

# My Algorithm (steps to solve the problem)

## Find the Roots of a Quadratic Equation
1. Get the Equation
2. Determine the Roots
3. State the Roots

##Get the Equation
1. Ask the person for the equation they want solved in standard form

##Determine the Roots
1. Determine if the roots will be real 
2. If there will be real roots, do as follows:  
*Calculate the Roots 

##Determine if the Roots will Be Real
1. Solve this equation with the associated values: b^2 - 4(a)(c)
2. If the result of that equation is negative:  
*there will be no real roots
3. Otherwise,  
*there will be real roots 

##Calculate the Roots
1. Multiply the value of "b" by -1 and save that value for later in the calculation
2. Take the square root of the equation b^2 - 4(a)(c) and save that for later on 
3. Multiply the value of "a" by 2 and save that value
4. Add the value from step 1 to the value in step 2, then divide by the value in step 3, storing this as one of your roots
5. Subtract the value from step 2 from the value from step 1, then divide by the value in step 3; storing this as your second root

##State the Roots
1. Tell the person whether or not their equation has real roots and how many if it does 
2. If it does have real roots:  
*Tell them what those roots are

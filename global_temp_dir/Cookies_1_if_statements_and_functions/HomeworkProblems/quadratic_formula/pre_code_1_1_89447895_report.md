## Find the Roots
 1. Get inputs
 2. Set formula up
 
## Get Inputs for A B and C
 1. Ask for 3 inputs: (a), (b), and (c)

## Set up Formula 
 1. X is a varialbe for the roots of the equation (a)x^2 + (b)x + (c)
 2. X = (-(b) (+ or -) sqrt((b)^2 - 4(a)(c))) / 2(a)

## Solve for X
 1. Find using +: X = (-(b) + sqrt((b)^2 - 4(a)(c))) / 2(a)
 2. Find using -: X = (-(b) - sqrt((b)^2 - 4(a)(c))) / 2(a)
 
## Find How Many Roots
 1. For using the +, if X is a real number it is a root, if it is an imaginary number, it is not.
 2. For using the -, if X is a real number it is a root, if it is an imaginary number, it is not.
 3. If both X's for the + and the - are the same number only count as 1 root.
 
## Count How Many
  1. Tally how many are roots giving a total of either 0, 1, or 2 roots. 
  
 ## Display the Roots
  1. If  + X was a real number, say the solution 1 is what X equaled
  2. If - X was a real number, say the solution 2 is what X equaled
  3. If neither were real numbers say there were no solutions

# Algorithm (steps to solve the problem)

# Differences
## Solve the quadratic equation
1.) Ask for user input

2.) Do the math

3.) Display the answer

## Ask for user input
1.) Ask the user for input for the equation by creating different functions for each variable

2.) Store them

## Do the math
1.) Use the user input collected previously to build your quadratic equation

2.) Breakdown the quadratic formula to solve for the roots of the equation

3.) Use the discriminant to determine how many roots there are 

## If the discriminant was greater than 0
1.) There are two real solutions to the equation

2.) Calculate the two roots, one by adding and one by subtracting

3.) Display the roots

## If the discriminant equal 0
1.) There is one real solution to the equation

2.) Calculate the root 

3.) Display the root

## If the discriminant was not equal to 0 or not greater than 0 

1.) There are no real solutions to the equation

2.) Display that there are no real solutions to the equation

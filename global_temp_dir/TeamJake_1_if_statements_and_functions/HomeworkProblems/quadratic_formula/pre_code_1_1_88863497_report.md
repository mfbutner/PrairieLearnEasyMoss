# My Algorithm (steps to solve the problem)

## Get values for a, b, and c
1. a is the lead coefficient, coming before the variable x^2
2. b is the coefficient in front of the variable x
3. c is the constant value not attached to any x

## Plug in values into the quadratic formula
1. Replace instances of 'a' with the value of a
2. Replace instances of 'b' with the value of b
3. Replace instances of 'c' with the value of c

## Determine how many real roots the quadratic has
1. Evaluate the expression sqrt(b^2 - 4ac) 

 If negative, there are no real roots
 
 If zero, there is one real root
 
 If positive, there are two real roots

## Determine what the real roots are
1. If there is one real root

  divide -b by 2a to get the root
2. If there are two real roots

  divide -b by 2a to get the base value
 
  add sqrt(b^2 - 4ac) / 2a to the base value to get one of the real roots
 
  subtract sqrt(b^2 - 4ac) / 2a from the base value to get the other real root

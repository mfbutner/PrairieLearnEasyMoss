# Algorithm (steps to solve the problem)
1. Obtain the constants from the quadratic equation
2. Plug the constants into the quadratic formula
3. List the roots

## Obtain the constants fron the quadratic equation 
1. Get the constant a from the user
2. Get the constant b from the user
3. Get the constant c from the user

## Plug the constants into the quadratic formula and tell the user the results
1. Calculate the quantity under the radical in the quadratic formula
2. If there is a real root, calculate the version of the quadratic formula that adds the radical
3. If the quantity under the radical is negative, tell the user "There are no real solutions"
4. If the quantity under the radical is zero, tell the user "There is one real solution:" and then tell them the result from step 2 of this section
5. If the quantity under the radical is greater than zero, calculate the version of the quadratic formula that subtracts the radical
    1. tell the user "There are 2 real solutions"
    2. Tell them the result of step 2 of the "Plug the constants into the quadratic formula" section
    3. Tell them the result of step 5 of the "Plug the constants into the quadratic formula" section
    
# Differences
* I realized the prompt asked the user to provide a, b, and c rather than an equation from which I must determine a, b, and c.
* Professor Butner told me that I didn't need to provide the solution in as much detail, so I simplified the calculations I mentioned in the description. This added clarity
* I calculated the root that adds the radical in the quadratic formula before the one that subtract it becuase that's the order the auto-grader needed
* I comnbined section 3 and section 2 into one section

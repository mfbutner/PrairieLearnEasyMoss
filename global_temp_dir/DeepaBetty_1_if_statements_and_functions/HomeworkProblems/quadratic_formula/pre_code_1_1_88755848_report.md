# My Algorithm (steps to solve the problem)
## Get User Values
1. Get user input for the values of a, b, and c for the quadratic formula
 
##Calculate Number of Solutions
1.  Plug these values into the formula for the discriminant to see how many real solutions there are.
2. If the discriminant is equal to zero, there will be one real solution. If the discriminant is greater than zero there will be two real solutions. If the discriminant is less than zero there will be no real solutions.

##Calculation of Roots
1. If the discriminant evaluates to a number greater than 0 or equal to 0, then we can plug the user input values into the equation like normal.
2. There will be two separate equations that will be evaluated, as in the quadratic formula, there is a plus/minus before the square root.
3. After the equation is evaluated, we will have the root(s), if they are real numbers.

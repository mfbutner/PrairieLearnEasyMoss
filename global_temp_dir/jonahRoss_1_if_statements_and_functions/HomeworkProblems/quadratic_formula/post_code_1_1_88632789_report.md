# Algorithm (steps to solve the problem)

## Get input
1. Display the quadratic formula
2. Asked for a, b, and c (variables in the quadratic formula)

## Calculate and Print Results
1. Calculated discriminant
2. Depending on discriminant
    1. Displayed that there were no real solutions
    2. Displayed that there was one real solution and what the calculated solution was
    3. Displated that there were 2 real solutions and what thetwo calculated solutions were

# Differences
##Calculate and Print Results
1. Initially planned to do these in two separate steps, however found it easier to do them all at once
2. Planned to have the function doing the calculations to return the values to main to then be sent to be displayed, however ended up having the function just return 0 and have the displaying be in the same function as the calculations were being done as there were different print statements for different results in the discriminant which was already in the same function

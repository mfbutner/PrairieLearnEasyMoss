# My Algorithm (steps to solve the problem)

## Receive input

1. Show user what the quadratic formula is
2. Get a, b, and c from the user (variables in the quadratic formula)

## Calculate

1. Calculate the inside of the discriminant
2. Check if the number is negative, zero, or a positive number
    1. if negative, there will be no results
    2. if 0 there will be one result
    3. if positive number there will be two results
3. then use discriminant to calculate the rest of the quadratic formula and coming to the final answer

## Display results
1. Display how many results and what they are

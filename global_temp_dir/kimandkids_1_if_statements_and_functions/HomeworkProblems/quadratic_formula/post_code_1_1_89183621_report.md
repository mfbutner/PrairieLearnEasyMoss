# Algorithm (steps to solve the problem)

# Differences
The difference between the plan before and my actual code is the order of equation. In the plan I claim that answer how many solutions and what the solutions are should be the last part of the code, but I put them in each calculation steps. It is because I get confused and the computer couldn't read my code. So I changed it.
    
    Also In the plan, I just thought to set up the quadratic formula just as it is, but I did not just set up the quadratic formula. I set the sqrt calculation part seperately so that I can get no solution answer. In order to set up what make no solution, I had to separate the equation then set the condition of it.

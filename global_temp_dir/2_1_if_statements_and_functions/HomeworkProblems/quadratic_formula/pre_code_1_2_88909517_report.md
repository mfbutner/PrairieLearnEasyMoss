# Solve a quadratic equation using quadratic formula (steps to solve the problem)
## Set up a quadratic equation

        1. Write the quadratic formula out
        2. Ask the user for the three variables 
##Calculate the discriminant
        
        1. Calculate the square of the second variable minus 4 times the first 
        and the third variable
##Determine how many solutions the equation has and calculate the solutions
        1. If the discriminant is greater than 0
            a. It has two solutions
            b. Calculate the quadratic equation using the quadratic formula (using
            the plus sign in the numerator)
            c. Calculate the quadratic equation using the quadratic formula (using
            the minus sign in the numerator)
        2. If the discriminant is equal to 0
            a. It has one solution
            b. Calculate the quadratic equation using the quadratic formula (either
            plus or minus sign yields to the same solution)
        3. If the discriminant is smaller than 0
            a. It has zero solution

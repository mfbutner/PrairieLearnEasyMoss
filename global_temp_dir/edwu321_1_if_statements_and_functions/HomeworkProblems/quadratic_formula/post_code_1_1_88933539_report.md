# Algorithm (steps to solve the problem)

# __Set up Equation__
1. Use quadratic formula 
2. Determine what a, b, and c values we want to use for the equation. 
3. Determine what values work and don't work.

# __Solve equation__
1. Obtain a, b, and c values from the equation (ax^2+bx+c) to use in the quadratic formula (x = (-b plus or minus square root of b^2 - 4ac) divided by 2a).
2. Plug them in the values from above. 
3. Solve it
4. Announce results

# __Equation is solved__
1. The equation returns a result. 

# __Announce Results__
1. 2 real roots
2. 1 real root
3. no possible solution 


# __Determine if there are two roots__
1. if the discriminant (square root of b^2 - 4ac) is greater than 0, there are two real root numbers.

# __Determine if there is one root__
1. if the discriminant (square root of b^2 - 4ac) is equal to 0, there is one real root number. 
    
# __Determine if there are no possible roots/solutions__
1. if the discriminant (square root of b^2 - 4ac) is less than 0, there is no possible solution because too small to calculate.

# __Differences__
- I realized after further reading into the problem that if the discriminant is less than 0,  it would be too small to calculate but I realized this was wrong because it's actually supposed to be no solution anyways because it would be trying to calculate complex/imaginary roots of the quadratic function. 
- I also realized my mistake in my first step in "Solve the equation" because I said to solve the equation BEFORE getting the a, b, and c values, which doesn't make sense because you can't solve an equation with no values so I switched them around.
 - I also combined two steps because I realized I basically had two "Solve the equation" steps so I just removed the 1st one and combined it in to the second one to also make it more clear that you should set up the equation before solving it.

# My Algorithm (steps to solve the problem)

# __Solve the equation__
1. Set up the quadratic formula(x = (-b plus or minus square root of b^2 - 4ac) divided by 2a
2. Solve it
3. Get values results from quadratioc equation (ax^2+bx+c)

# __Set up Equation__
1. Use quadratic formula (
2. Determine what a, b, and c values we want to use for the equation. 
3. Determine what values work and don't work.

# __Solve equation__
1. Obtain a, b, and c values to use in the equation.
2. Plug them in the values from above. 
3. Announce results

# __Equation is solved__
1. The equation returns a result. 

# __Announce Results__
1. 2 real roots
2. 1 real root
3. no possible solution 


# __Determine if there are two roots__
1. if the discriminant (square root of b^2 - 4ac) is greater than 0, there are two real root numbers.

# __Determine if there is one root__
1. if the discriminant (square root of b^2 - 4ac) is equal to 0, there is one real root number. 
    
# __Determine if there are no possible roots/solutions__
1. if the discriminant (square root of b^2 - 4ac) is less than 0, there is no possible solution because too small to calculate.

# My Algorithm (steps to solve the problem)

## Set Up Questions 

1. Declare variable double determinate of a,b,c
2. Show the user the quadratic formula 
3. Asker user to input a number for a,b,c 

## Solving the problem 

1. If the determinate is less than 0 then the program will print say that there are no real solutions
2. If the discriminate is greater than or equal to zero then it will calculate the math 

## Math problem solving 

1. Create a variable called root and convert it into a double 
2. This variable will take a negative of B input and add it to the square root of the discriminate 
3. Then we will divide all this by two multiplied by the input of a
4. When this runs the output of the program will say there are one or two real solutions and print those two solutions out 

## If the second solution doesn't work 

1.Make another variable called root and this negative B input will be divided by 2 times the A input
2.When this runs it will only print out saying there is one real solution

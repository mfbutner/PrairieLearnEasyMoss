# Algorithm (steps to solve the problem)

## Getting Values for the Quadratic Formula 
1. Ask the user for a number for a 
2. Ask the user for a number for b
3. Ask the user for a number for c 

## Decide How Many Real Solutions There Are 
1. Input the variables into the quadratic formula 
    * The equation is b squared minus 4 times a times c)
2. Check if the value is less than, greater than, or equal to 0 
    * There will be two real solutions if the value of the equation is greater than 0 
    * There will be one real solution if the value of the equation is equal to 0 
    * There will be no real solutions if the value of the equation is less than 0

## Finding the Two Real Solutions 
1. If there are two real solutions, plug the variables into the full quadratic equation
    * The full quadratic equation will be negative b plus and minus the square root of b squared minus 4 times a times c divided by 2 times a 
2. The two values after plugging into the formula will be the two real solutions

## Finding One Real Solution 
1. If there is one real solution, plug variables into formula 
    * The formula is negative b divided by 2 times a

# My Algorithm (steps to solve the problem)

## Explain How To Solve: Quadratic Formula
    1. Set up the quadratic formula form
    2. Type a quadratic formula for test
    3. Show the result
    
## Set up a quadratic formula form:
    1. Set up there is a quadratic equation with ax^2 + bx + c form
    2. Define the class of 'a' is a number
    3. Define the class of 'b' is a number 
    4. Define the class of 'c' is a number 
    
## Type a quadratic formula for test:
    1. Ask the user type a number of 'a'
    2. Ask the user type a number of 'b'
    3. Ask the user type a number of 'c'

## Show the result:
    1. The results depends on the equation : 'b' square minus the sum of 4 times 'a' times 'c'
    2. Input the each variable number to 'a', 'b', and 'c'
    3. If the equation greater than zero, show the results have two solutions, which by using the formula of the roots of a quadratic equation are values of x
    4. If the equation equal to zero, show the result has one solution, which the result is negatice 'b' divided by negative two times 'a'
    5. If the equation less than zero, show the result have no solutions
    6. After the the result announced, end the program

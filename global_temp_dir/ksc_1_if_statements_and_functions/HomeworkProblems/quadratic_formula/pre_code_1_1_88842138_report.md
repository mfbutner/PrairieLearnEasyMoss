# My Algorithm (steps to solve the problem)


## Get the Variable Values
1. Ask user for value of a
2. Ask user for value of b
3. Ask user for value of c

## Find the Real Solutions
1. Find the number of real solutions
2. Find the numerator(s)
3. Find the denominator
4. Divide the numerator(s) by the denominator

## Find the Number of Real Solutions
1. Find the value of the discriminant
* If the discriminant is less than 0, say there are no real solutions
* If the discriminant is equal to 0, there is one real solution
* If the discriminant is greater than 0, there are two real solutions

## Find Numerators
1. Multiply b by -1
3. Take the square root of the discriminant
4. If there are two real solutions
* The first numerator is the sum of -b and the radical
* The second numerator is the difference between -b and the radical
5. If there is one real solution
* The numerator is -b

## Find Denominator
1. Multiply a by 2

## Divide Numerators by Denominator
1. Divide the first numerator by the denominator
2. If there are two real solutions
* Divide the second numerator by the denominator

## Find the Value of the Discriminant
1. Multiply b by b
2. Multiply a by c by 4
3. Subtract 4ac from b^2

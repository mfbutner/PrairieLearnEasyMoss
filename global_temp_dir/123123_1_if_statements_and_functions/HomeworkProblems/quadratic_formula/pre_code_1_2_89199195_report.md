# My Algorithm (steps to solve the problem)

## Set up 
1. We will given a quadraic equation. 

## How Many Solutions We Have
1. To calculate (b^2 - 4*a*c). 
2. When (b^2 - 4*a*c) is greater than 0, we have 2 real solutions.
3. When (b^2 - 4*a*c) equals to 0, we have 1 real solution.
4. When (b^2 - 4*a*c) is smaller than 0, we have no real solutions.

## What is the solutions
1. When (b^2 - 4*a*c) is greater than 0, we can calculate the solutions by the formula that x = (-b + (b^2 - 4*a*c)^(1/2)) / (2a) and x = (-b - (b^2 - 4*a*c)^(1/2)) / (2a).
2. When (b^2 - 4*a*c) equals to 0, we can calculate the solutions by the formula that x = (-b) / (2a), since (b^2 - 4*a*c)^(1/2) = 0.
3. When (b^2 - 4*a*c) is smaller than 0, we can see that we do not have real solutions since numbers in square root cannot smaller than 0, otherwise, it does not have real solutions.

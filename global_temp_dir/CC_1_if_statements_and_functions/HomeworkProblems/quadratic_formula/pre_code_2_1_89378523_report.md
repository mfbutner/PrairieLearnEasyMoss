# My Algorithm (steps to solve the problem)

# How I solved this problem: 

## First, create a function and find the variable of input and output

##Second, setup the print part and the formula

##Third, setup the if part
###If d is smaller than 0
####There will be no solution

###If d is greater than 0
####There will be two solution
####print solution 1 and 2

###If d is equal to 0
####There will be one solution
####print the solution

##Return to the main function

# Algorithm (steps to solve the problem)

# Differences
* the order of variables x1, x2 is moved before asking the constant numbers and giving the form of equation

* delta calculation moves from the second function to the first fucntion because it should be used in the second function

* let the results have 2 decimal points can be included in the second function becase that will be more convenient in showing the final results for user

# My Algorithm (steps to solve the problem)
quad.c

This program is to solve a quadratic equation and find its real solutions

##1. set up the basic function
    1. set up 3 constant as variables a, b, c
      a. give user the quadratic equation form
      b. ask for number of a, b, c
    2. set up 2 root as variables x1, x2
    
##2. calculate the equation
    1. get the delta number and distinguish it for 3 situations
      a. When delta is larger than 0, there will be 2 solutions for equation 
      b. When delta is equal to 0, there will be 1 solutions for equation 
      c. When delta is less than 0, there will be no solutions for equation
      
    2. using formula to get real solution results, making sure the results have 2 decimal points

3. end the function

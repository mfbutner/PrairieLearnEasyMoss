## Solve for roots of a quadratic using quadratic formula
1. Ask for quadratic 
2. Apply to quadratic formula
3. Solve equation 
- There were no differences between my original and current solutions 

## Ask for quadratic 
1. Ask for "a" value 
2. Ask for "b" value
3. Ask for "c" value 
- Did not need the quadratic equation "a times x squared plus b times x minus c" since to solve for roots, only needed values a, b, and c. Plus would then later plug it into the quadratic formula so quadratic equation was not needed. 

## Apply to quadratic formula
1. Plug values into quadratic formula
    1. plug "a" into the a in formula
    2. plug "b" into the b in formula
    3. plug "c" into the c in formula
2. Set and solve for the discriminant 
    1. wrote out formula for discriminant 
        1. square b value under square root subtracted by 4 times a times c in numerator for the discriminant value
    2. set denominator value to be two times a
- instead of writing out the whole quadratic formula together, i chose to split it up into the discriminant being its own equation and then the denominator its own separate variable. this helped to easily check if there would be one, two, or no real solutions, since taking the square root of a negative number is not possible, square root that is greater than 0 will be likely two solution, unless the discriminant is 0 where there is only one solution.

## Determine if one, two, or no real solutions 
1. check if discriminant was less than 0 
    1. if discriminant is less than 0 means no real solution 
2. if discriminant was greather than 0 
    1. there is two real solutions 
    2. Substitute discriminant into the quadratic fromula  
        1. split equation
            1. separate the equation to two equations one adding or positive and one subtracting or negative values 
    3. Solve
        1. solve for x in equation that is positive
            1. divide by 2 * a in denominator
        2. solve for x in equation that is negative 
            1. divide by 2 * a in denominator 
        3. the roots are the two values found from solving the entire equation of quadratic

- did not have to substitute values into quadratic. instead, i checked the discriminants value to determine if all roots were real, one, or no solution by checking if the discriminant was greater than 0, less than 0, or equal to zero
- instead of substituting in values, i simply used a print statement to print out that there were no real solutions so that it would cause the function to end 
-checking if the discriminant is less than 0 dealt with the possibilities that there was a negative number in the numerator aka the discriminant value
-i used the discriminant to verify if the solution was real, one, or two solutions instead and did not need to use the quadratic equation to do substitution for verifying the answers if it was real, two, or one real solution 
- i only solved for the whole quadratic formula where i plugged discriminant values while also using values from user a,b,c only if the discriminant was greater than 0 rather than for all cases where the discriminant is less than 0 or equal to 0. 

## Solve for x in equation that is positive
1. add numerators together
2. keep denominator
- There were no differences between my original and current solutions 

## Add numerators
1. if numerators cannot be added keep numerator as is
- There were no differences between my original and current solutions 

## Solve for x in equation that is negative
1. subtract numerators together 
2. keep denominator 
- There were no differences between my original and current solutions 

## If both numerators cannot be subtracted or added 
1. separate equation to two solutions one positive and negative keeping the entire numerator the same 
- There was no differences between my original and current solutions


## Two real solutions
1. If the discriminant was greater than 0, take the square root of discriminant and solve for the entire numerator of the quadratic equation 
- Did not have to sub back in values to quadratic, instead i set the discriminant being greater than 0 to define that there would be 2 real solutions.

## One real solution 
1. If the discriminant was neither greater than 0 or was it less than 0, meaning that the discriminant is equal, solve the quadratic formula. 
- Did not have to set equation equal to 0, the main thing that helped to check this was the discriminant value. If the discrimiant was = 0 , this meant that there was one real solution. So I instead checked my solutions using the discriminant's value. 

## No real solution 
1. If the discriminant is less than 0, then automatically, there are no real solutions.
- no real solutions were could be determined by the discriminat that i included, which helped to print out that there was no real solution based on its value.

# My Algorithm (steps to solve the problem)

## Solve for roots of a quadratic using quadratic formula
1. Ask for quadratic  
2. Apply to quadratic formula
3. Solve equation 

## Ask for quadratic 
1. Write out quadratic
    - quadratic is a times x squared plus b times x minus c 
2. Ask for "a" value 
3. Ask for "b" value
4. Ask for "c" value 

## Apply to quadratic formula
1. Write out quadratic formula
    - quadratic formula is negative b plus or minus the squareroot of b squared minus four times a times c divided by two twice a 
2. Plug values into quadratic formula
    - plug "a" into the a in formula
    - plug "b" into the b in formula
    - plug "c" into the c in formula
3. Simplify equation
    - square b value under square root
    - multiply 4 by a and c in numerator
    - multiply 2 by a in denominator 

## Solve equation 
1. Simplify further
    - combine remaining like terms under square root
    - take square root of that number
2. Split equation 
    - separate the equation to two equations one adding or positive and one subtracting or negative values 
3. Solve
    - solve for x in equation that is positive
    - solve for x in equation that is negative
4. Simplify 
    - simplify both x solutions 
5. Verify solutions
    - substitute both solutions into quadratic equation and solve to determine if one solution, two solution, or no solution is the real answer 

## Take square root of that number
1. if inside square root is negative rewrite the value inside into -1 times the value in the square root
2. rewrite the square root that is not -1 into two factors of that number and multiply them together
3. take the square root of all non-negative square roots
4. replace the original square root of -1 from the beginning with i for the imaginary number

## Solve for x in equation that is positive
1. add numerators together
2. keep denominator

## Add numerators
1. if numerators cannot be added keep numerator as is 

## Solve for x in equation that is negative
1. subtract numerators together 
2. keep denominator 

## Subtract numerators
1. if numerators cannot be subtracted keep numerator as is

## If both numerators cannot be subtracted or added 
1. separate equation to two solutions one positive and negative keeping the entire numerator the same 

## Simplify both x solutions 
1. divide by common denominator to numerator and denominator to simplify solutions

## Substitute both solutions into quadratic equation
1. set quadratic equal to 0
2. substitute positive solution into where x is in quadratic and repeat for negative solution 
    - combine like terms and solve quadratic 

## Two real solutions
1. after solving the quadratic, if the equation results as 0 than both the positive and negative solutions are real answers 

## One real solution 
1. after solving the quadratic, if the equation results as 0 for only one of the two solutions, negative and positive, only the solution that equals 0 is the solution

## No real solution 
1. after solving the quadratic by plugging the positive and negative solutions in, if the equation results in a value other than 0 or contains an imaginary number there are no real solutions

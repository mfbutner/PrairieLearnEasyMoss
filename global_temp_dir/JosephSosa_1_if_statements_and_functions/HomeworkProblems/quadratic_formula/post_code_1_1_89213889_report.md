#Solving Quadratic Formula
1. Get numbers 
2. Display solutions
##Check how many solutions there are
1. See if there either zero, one, or two solutions
2. Do this by solving inside the quadratic and see wether its negative number, zero, or a positive number
##Set up the two equations
1. Set up two equations one for the positive answer and the negative answer
2. Make sure the equation is set up correctly
###Get the answers 
1. After determing how many solutions there are you can now get your answers
* If there is zero give the zero solutions answer
* If there is one solution you can use the positive answer or negative answer solution, because the radical was zero it does not play a role wether it was plus or minus
* If there is two solutions you use the positive answer and negative answer solutions.
####Display results
1. This goes on while your getting the answer, but just to clarify. While you are getting the answers display what you want each solution to display. 
# Differences
There was a lot of differences. I had to use a method of describing how many solutions there were first and foremost. After I found out how many solutions there were I then set up the equation and not just find out how many solutions there are during it. Then I did create the equation, but did not get the answers until the very end. While I displayed the results I then displayed the answers with its proper formating on how many solutions and which one there were. I also had to make sure the positive answer was displayed first than the negative answer for the two solutions answer.

# My Algorithm (steps to solve the problem)
1)	Solve Quadratic Equation

* Ask user for input.

* Solve problem.

2)	Ask user for input

* Let the user input A,B,C which represent the coefficients of the polynomial Ax^2 + Bx + C. 

3)	Solve the problem

* Solve the discriminant first (part under the square root)

* Solve the numerator with a positive square root of the discriminant

* Solve the numerator and denominator

* Solve the numerator with a negative square root of the discriminant

* Solve the numerator and denominator

* Give back both value

4)	Solve the discriminant.

* Take the value B and square it

* The 4 times A times C from the squared value of B

5)	Solve the numerator with a positive square root. 

* Take the negative of B and add the value received in part 4

6)	Solve the numerator and the denominator

* Take the value received in part 5 and divide it by 2 times A

7)	Solve the numerator with a negative square root. 

* Take the negative of B and subtract the value received in part 4

8)	Solve the numerator and the denominator

* Take the value received in part 5 and divide it by 2 times A

9)	Give back both values

* Give back the values calculated in part 8 and 6.

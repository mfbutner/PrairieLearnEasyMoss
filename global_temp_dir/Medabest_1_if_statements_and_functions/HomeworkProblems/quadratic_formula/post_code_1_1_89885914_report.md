##Get values for Quadratic Formula
1. Show the quadratic formula
2. ask user for a
3. ask user for b
4. ask user for c

##Calculate the formula
1. Calculate the root
    * if the inside of the root is less than zero, then there are no solutions
2. Perform the quadratic formula using + the root and - the root
    * if the adding and subtracting variations of the formula have different results, there are 2 solutions
    * if they are the same result, then there is only one solution

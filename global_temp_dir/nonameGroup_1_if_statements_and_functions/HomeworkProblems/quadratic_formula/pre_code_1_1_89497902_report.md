# My Algorithm (steps to solve the problem)


##Quadratic formula 
1.- ask the user for values

2.- With the values that the user provided do the equation

##Ask the user for values
1.- show the user the equation of the quadratic formula 

a*x^2 + b * x + c

2.- ask for a value for each letter (a,b,c) 

##With the values we can do the equation
1.- We do the equation and check if it had no real solutions
one real solution or if it had 2 solutions

2.- Show the user the finished answer

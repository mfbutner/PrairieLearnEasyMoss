# My Algorithm (steps to solve the problem)

## Solve The Quadratic Question

1, Setup the question input

2, Solve the question

## Setup the question input

1, Determine the value of "a" , "b" and "c"

2, Determine the number of roots of quadratic question by (_b^2 - 4ac_)

         a, (_b^2 - 4ac_) equal to 0
         
         b, (_b^2 - 4ac_) larger than 0
         
         c, (_b^2 - 4ac_) less than 0
         
## Slove The Question

1, when (_b^2 - 4ac_) equal to 0 , there are no roots

2, when (_b^2 - 4ac_) larger than 0, there are two roots

3, (_b^2 - 4ac_) less than 0, there is only one root

4, Announce result

## (_b^2 - 4ac_) equal to 0

1, root equal to (-b/2a)

## (_b^2 - 4ac_) larger than 0

1, root1 equal to (-b + sqrt(b^2 - 4ac))/(2*a)

2, root2 equal to (-b - sqrt(b^2 - 4ac))/(2*a)

## (_b^2 - 4ac_) less than 0

1, Just announce that there are no root

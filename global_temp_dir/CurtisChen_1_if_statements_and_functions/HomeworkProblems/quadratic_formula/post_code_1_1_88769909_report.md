# Algorithm (steps to solve the problem)

## Main Function
1.  Get the three coefficients
2.  Plug them into both possibilities for the quadratic formula
3.  Give the solutions and determine how many number of solutions there are
* There can be 2 real solutions, one real solution, or no real solution
*  There is two real solutions if both possibilities for the quadratic formula give out different answers
*  There is one real solution if both possibilities for the quadratic formula give the same answer
*  There is no real solutions if the value found inside the squareroot of the quadratic formula is negative(b^2 - 4ac)
* a, b, & c being the coefficients respectively

## Positive Quadratic Function 
1. With the coefficients as a, b, and c respectively, plug it into (-b + sqrt(b^2 - 4ac))/ 2a)

## Negative Quadratic Function 
1. With the coefficients as a, b, and c respectively, plug it into (-b - sqrt(b^2 - 4ac))/ 2a)

# Differences
## Number of Solutions
1.  initally, I did not check for how many solutions there were, only if there were no solutions. So if both the possibilities equate to the same value, it will say that there is only one solution.

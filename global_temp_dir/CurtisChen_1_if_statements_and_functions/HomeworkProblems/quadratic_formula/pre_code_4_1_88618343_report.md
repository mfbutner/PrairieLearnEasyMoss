## Do Quadratic Formula
1. find the coefficients
2.  plug them into the equation

## Finding the Coefficients
1.  Given a quadratic equation in the form of ax^2 + bx + c, take the coefficients
   * the coefficients are a, b, and c
   
## The Quadratic Formula
1.  There are two cases of the quadratic formula
  * x = -b + the squareroot of b^2 - 4ac all divided by 2a
  *  x = -b - the squareroot of b^2 - 4ac all divided by 2a

## Plugging Into the Equation
1. plug in the coefficients for a, b, and c respectively.
2.  You should get two possible solutions, one for each case

## Cases That Don't Work
1.  if b^2 - 4ac is a negative number, then the solution is not a real solution

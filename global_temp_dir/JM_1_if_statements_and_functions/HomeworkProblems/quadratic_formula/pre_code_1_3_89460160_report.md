# My Algorithm 

1. Divide Numerator by the Denominator 

## Find Numerator 

1. Solve the square root

2. Multiply b by -1

3. Subtract the square root solution from -b to find first solution

4. Add the square root solution to -b to find the second solution


## Solving square root
1. Multiply b by itself

2. Multiply 4 times a times c

3. Subtract the solution from step 2 from step 1

4. Take the square root of step 3

## Find Denominator

1. Multiple a by 2

Find root of quadratic equation
    1. Look at coeffient of (number in front of) x^2 term 
    2. Look at coefficient of (number in front of) x term
    3. Look at constant coefficient (last number at the end of expression)

Calculate root using quadratic equation
    1. Multiply coefficient of x term by -1 
    2 Add and subtract it to a square root with
        1. coefficient of x, squared 
        2. minus the coefficient of x^2 
        3. times the constant coefficient
        4. times 4
    3. All of that will be divided by 2 times the coefficient of x^2
    4. Find the value or values that are returned which can be positive, negative or both.
    5. You have found the root(s) of the quadratic equation

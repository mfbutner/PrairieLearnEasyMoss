# My Algorithm (steps to solve the problem)

## Solve the quadratic function + get the roots 
1. Solve to see how many roots 
2. Print the solutions 

##Get user input
1. Use a series of statements to gather user input for each value a,b,c
2. Store each of these values (since there are no decimal values needed for this)

##Solving the discriminant
1. Create a value named discriminant and set it equal to b^2-4ac.
2. Find the discriminant which is b^2-4ac --> this will tell us how many roots there are (if any)

##Interpreting the results of the discriminant 
1. b^2-4ac < 0 --> No real solutions (b/c square root becomes negative)
2. b^2-4ac > 0 --> 2 real solutions
3. b^2-4ac = 0 --> 1 real solution 

##Printing the solutions
1. If there are no real solutions, terminate the program
2. Otherwise, we have to solve for however many solutions

##Quadratic Formula
1. Compute the quadratic formula by passing through the a,b,c values 
2. Formula is equal to -b plus or minus the square root of b^2-4ac, all over 2a

##Final Printing
1. Print the final values/roots to the equation
2. Print the positive solution before showing the negative one if there are two possible solutions

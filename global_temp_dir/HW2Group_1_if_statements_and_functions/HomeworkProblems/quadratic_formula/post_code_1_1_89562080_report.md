# Algorithm (steps to solve the problem)

# Differences


##Ordering
1. The order in which I designed the program was slightly different to the actual one I ended up using. I had to gain the user's input after I designed how to do the computational parts (discriminant + executing the formula).


##Quadratic Formula + Printing the Solutions
1. In order to print the two solutions, I had to split up the solutions into two parts. I did not include the plus/minus in my original plan and had to implement that into my program for when the discriminant was greater than 0.
2. I used the word "terminate" when referring to the program and it having no solutions,when I had to add another branch.

##Final Printing
1. After rewatching Professor Butner's lectures, I realized that I should include some leeway for whitespace while the user enters their input. I had to then account for whitespace and make sure the program did not crash if the user added an extra space while entering a, b, and c.

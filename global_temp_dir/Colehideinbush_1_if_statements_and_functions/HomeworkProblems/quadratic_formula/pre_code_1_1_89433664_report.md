# My Algorithm (steps to solve the problem)
## 1. Set up the quadratic equation
## 2. Use the quadratic equation

 
---
#Set up the Equation
## 1. set up variable a, b and c.
## 2. set up the two roots for equation solutions.

----
#Use the quadratic equation
## 1. ask user for inputs for a, b and c.
## 2. check the discriminant for the amount of real solutions
## 3. tell the user how many real solutions there are and what they are.
## 4. At the end of program, make sure that a, b, and c are 0 again.

# My Algorithm (steps to solve the problem)
## Solve the Quadratic Formula
1. Get a quadratic equation for the quadratic formula
2. Plug the coefficients and constant c into the quadratic equation and solve for x

## Write Out the Quadratic equation wanting to be solved
1. Write out the quadratic equation in the form ax2+bx+c=0
2. If it's not already in this format, then subtract or add each component so the equation is equal to zero
3. Any coefficients or constant c can also be negative
  if your equation calls for it
    * For example lets say an equation is in this format: ax2= -bx + c
    * We would we add the bx and subtract the c on the right side in order to get them to the left side and final have our equation in the proper format: ax2+bx-c = 0

## Identify the coefficients and constant c of the equation
1. The coefficients needing to be identified are a and b within the formula above
2. Constant letter c also needs to be identified in the formula above
3. If there is no written leading coefficient for a or be, then we can assume they equal 1
    * For example let's say x2+8x+15=0 is our quadratic equation, a= 1, b= 8, and c= 15

## Write out the quadratic Formula  and replace with the Values of A, B, and C
1. With our coefficients and constant c in mind, we must now write out the quadratic formula, which will always be in the same form regardless of what a, b, and c are
2.  x = (-b+-[?]b2-(4ac))/(2a) is the form in which we want to write the formula in
3. With this formula in mind we now replace the a, b, and c's in it with the values of our coefficients and constant c
    * For our example this would turn the quadratic equation into:
    x = (-8+-[?]82-(4(1)(15)))/(2(1))

## Solve the Problem
1. With the coefficients and constant from our quadratic equation now plugged into the quadratic formula, we can solve for x
2. First, we must solve what is in the square root of the problem and hope it turns out to a perfect square
    * If it's not a perfect square, we will leave in the most simplified square root format we can
3. Next we multiply the 2 and value for the coefficient a on the bottom of the fraction
4. Now, since everything in the equation is multiplied out we can pull two separate equations from the Formula and solve them in there unsimplified form. One where we add the value from the square root and one where we subtract the value form the square root.
    * In our examples case, all these steps would look like this:
        1. x = -8+-[?]82-(4(1)(15))/2(1)= -8+-[?]64-60/2(1)= -8+-[?]4/2= -8+-[?]4/2(1) = -8+-2/2(1)
        2. -8+-2/2
        3. Equation one: -8+2/2 = -6/2 (unsimplified form)
        4. Equation two: -8-2/2 = -10/2 (unsimplified form)

## Simplify if possible
1. First, if your unsimplified has a square root that can't be  a perfect square or a fraction that can't be calculated as a whole and fully simplified , then then the unsimplified form is your final answer!
2. If your unsimplified answer can be calculated as a whole number or maybe some of the numbers in your fraction can be simplified further down, then do so with each equations
    * For our example, each equation can be simplified to a whole number:
        1. Equation one: -6/2 = -3 (simplified form)    
        2. Equation two: -10/2 = -5 (simplified form)
        3. Now you have fully solved the quadratic formula and can repeat as many times as needed with other quadratic equations

# Algorithm (steps to solve the problem)
## Solve the Quadratic Formula
1. Get a quadratic equation for the quadratic formula
2. Plug the coefficients and constant c into the quadratic equation and solve for x
3. Depending on what is underneath the square root of the quadratic formula the quadratic equation chosen, you will have zero, one, or two real answer!

## Write Out the Quadratic equation wanting to be solved
1. Write out the quadratic equation in the form ax2+bx+c=0
2. If it's not already in this format, then subtract or add each component so the equation is equal to zero
3. Any coefficients or constant c can also be negative
  if your equation calls for it
    * For example lets say an equation is in this format: ax2= -bx + c
    * We would we add the bx and subtract the c on the right side in order to get them to the left side and final have our equation in the proper format: ax2+bx-c = 0

## Identify the coefficients and constant c of the equation
1. The coefficients needing to be identified are a and b within the formula above
2. Constant letter c also needs to be identified in the formula above
3. If there is no written leading coefficient for a or be, then we can assume they equal 1
    * For example let's say x2+8x+15=0 is our quadratic equation, a= 1, b= 8, and c= 15

## Write out the quadratic Formula and replace with the Values of A, B, and C
1. With our coefficients and constant c in mind, we must now write out the quadratic formula, which will always be in the same form regardless of what a, b, and c are
2.  x = (-b+-[?]b2-(4ac))/(2a) is the form in which we want to write the formula in
3. With this formula in mind we now replace the a, b, and c's in it with the values of our coefficients and constant c
    * For our example this would turn the quadratic equation into:
    x = (-8+-[?]82-(4(1)(15)))/(2(1))
    
##Solve the Problem with zero real solutions
1. If the number under the squareroot can't be a perfect square or isn't zero, then your whole formula can not be a real solution
2. If we were to allow the square root to be imperfect, the solution would turn into a rational solution

##Solve the Problem with one real solution
1. If the number under the squareroot turns out to be zero, then the +-[?]b2-(4ac) part of the formula can go away
2. After that part of the formula is gone you can solve for a single solution with the rest of the formula which would look like this: -b/2a
3. Solve that with your b and a, and your done!

## Solve the Problem with a perfect square
1. With the coefficients and constant from our quadratic equation now plugged into the quadratic formula, we can solve for x
2. First, we must solve what is in the square root of the problem and hope it turns out to a perfect square
    * If it's not a perfect square, there will either be zero or one solutions
3. Next we multiply the 2 and value for the coefficient a on the bottom of the fraction
4. Now, since everything in the equation is multiplied out we can pull two separate equations from the Formula and solve them in there unsimplified form. One where we add the value from the square root(if it's perfect) and one where we subtract the value form the square root (if it's perfect).
    * In our examples case, all these steps would look like this:
        1. x = -8+-[?]82-(4(1)(15))/2(1)= -8+-[?]64-60/2(1)= -8+-[?]4/2= -8+-[?]4/2(1) = -8+-2/2(1)
        2. -8+-2/2
        3. Equation one: -8+2/2 = -6/2 (unsimplified form)
        4. Equation two: -8-2/2 = -10/2 (unsimplified form)

## Simplify if possible
1. First, if your unsimplified fraction has a square root that can't be a perfect square or a fraction that can't be calculated as a whole and fully simplified , then then the unsimplified form is your final answer!
2. If your unsimplified answer can be calculated as a whole number or maybe some of the numbers in your fraction can be simplified further down, then do so with each equations
    * For our example, each equation can be simplified to a whole number:
        1. Equation one: -6/2 = -3 (simplified form)    
        2. Equation two: -10/2 = -5 (simplified form)
        3. Now you have fully solved the quadratic formula and can repeat as many times as needed with other quadratic equations

# Differences
*  I made sure to add the fact that the way we are solving the quadratic formula will only be solving for real solution and not rational solutions
*  I added the steps on how to solve the problem for zero real solutions and one real solution
*  Made sure to tell the reader that they can't simplify the formula if the number under the square root doesn't lead to a perfect square
*  This is just a side note, but I wrote all of this in markdown on my own text editor and it recognized the sq root symbol and the square symbol, but for both this and the first part of this problem [?] = square root and x2= x^2

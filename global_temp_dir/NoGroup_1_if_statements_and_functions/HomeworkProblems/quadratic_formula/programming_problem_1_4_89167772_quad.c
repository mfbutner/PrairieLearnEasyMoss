/* Author: Nicol√°s Kennedy
 * Filename: quad.c
 * Description:
 *  This program takes three double values from standard in, which correspond to the three coefficients of a general quadratic formula when equated to 0: ax^2 + bx + c = 0; Then, the program computes the real roots of this equation, and outputs the roots if they exist. If roots are imaginary, then the program will output that no real roots exist.

##3. Display roots

#Determine number of roots
##1. Ask user to enter a, b, and c
##2. Use discriminant to determine how many, if any, roots are real
###a. if discriminant is greater than 0, there are two real roots
###b. if discriminant is equal to 0, there is one real root
###c. if discriminant is less than 0, there are no real roots

#Calculate Roots
##1. Given that the quadratic formula is has both a "plus" version and a "minus" version, split the equation into two separate equations.
##2. Use separated quadratic formula to calculate the roots
#Display roots
##1. If there were two real roots, display both the answer to the "plus" version of the equation and the "minus" version of the equation.
##2. If there was one real root, display the answer to the "plus" version of the equation.
##3. If there were no real roots, display such.

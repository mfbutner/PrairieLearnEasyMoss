##Find The Real Roots of x From a Quadratic Equation
1. Get a quadratic equation from user.
2. Use quadratic formula for find the the real roots of x.
3. Display the real roots of x.

## Get the Quadratic Equation From User
1. Use the quadratic equation form of ax^2 + bx + c.
2. Ask the user for a:
3. Ask the user for b:
4. Ask the user for c:

## Use Quadratic Formula to Find Real Roots of x
1. Check if the solutions will be real roots.
    * Had to check if solutions will be real roots before to make sure quadratic equation can be used normally and create real solutions.
2. Fill in the a, b, and c into quadratic formula.
3. Determine how many real solution(s) exist.

## Check if the solution(s) will be real roots 
* Added this in to make sure by using quadratic formula it will have a real solution and not an imaginary one.
1. Solve for the inside of the square root part of the quadratic formula.
2. If solution is greater than or equal to zero, than using quadratic formula will create real solution(s).
3. If solution is less than zero, than square rooting the solution will create a imaginary solution.

## Fill in the a, b, and c into the Quadratic Formula
1. First check if the solution(s) will be real, if so continue on, if not then skip to next section.
    * Added this in so the quadratic formula will only be used if it will create a real solution.
2. Use the quadratic forumla with the plus to find the first real root.
3. Use the quadratic formula with the minus to find the second real root.

## Determine how many real solutions exist.
* Had to add this in to do a more thourough check on how many real solutions exist.
1. If the solution(s) checked out to not be real, then there is no real solutions.
2. If the quadratic formula solutions with the plus and minus equal each other, then there is one real solution.
3. If the quadratic formula solutions with the plus and minus do not equal each other, then the there is two real solutions.

## Display the real roots of x
1. Say how many real solutions there are.
2. Say the real solutions, if any.

# My Algorithm (steps to solve the problem)

##Define Equations
1. Define the quadratic formula 2 ways (+,-)
2. Define discriminant function (so we know how many roots there will be.

##Get the input
1. Tell the user how we want the input
2. Get the input

##Figure out Roots
1. Find out how many roots we will have based on the input and the discriminant function
2. Once we know how many roots there are will, we will do the calculations based on how many roots we found there to be.
3. Print results

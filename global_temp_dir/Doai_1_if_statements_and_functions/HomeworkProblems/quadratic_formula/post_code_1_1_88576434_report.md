# Algorithm (steps to solve the problem)

# Differences
I didn't separate step 3 & 4

I would need a variable to keep track of which case is going to run considering the result of the determinant.
It would have been a lot longer if I didn't combine them since I would need another if and else if and else in order to print out the solutions.

By combining them, I could use the same if and else if for finding which case it is and printing at the same time.

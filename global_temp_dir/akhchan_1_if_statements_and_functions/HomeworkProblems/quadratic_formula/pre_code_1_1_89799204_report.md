#Getting all the values
1. find out what a, b, and c are in the form of ax^2 + bx + c.

##Plug the values into the quadratic formula.
2. After getting all the values for a, b, and c, you can now solve for x
3. Start off with negative b. 
4. From then, there are two ways to go, to get two different solutions

###First Solution (+)
1. to the negative b, add the square root of(b squared - (4 times a and c))
2. then divide all that by (2 times a)

####Second Solution (-)
1. to the negatvie b, subtract the sqare root of (b squared - (4 times a and c))
2. then divide all that by (2 times a)

#####How many solutions
1. After plugging in the values into the quadratic formula, there will be either one, two or no valid solutions. 
2. If there is one valid solution, then say that solution
3. If there are two valid solutions, then say the two solutions
4. If there are no valid solutions, then say that there are no valid solutions.

##Differences
1. We first checked to see if the numerator was positive, negative, or equal to 0.
2. It also allows us to check the number of solutions we would get.
3. From there, we used the right formula for the outcome of the numerator.
4. Changes to the positive calculation

##Using the quadratic formula
1. Setup the equation that given "ax^2 +bx +c" and "x=-b+- sqrt(b^2 -4ac)/2a"
2. Check for the amount of solutions
3. Calculate the solutions
4. Show the results
5. Display how many solutions there are (none, 1, or 2)
6. Display the solution

##Setup the equation
1. Ask for a, b, and c
2. Identify the values of a, b and c 
3. Once a, b and c are defined we plug them into the numerator of the quadratic formula.
    1. If the numerator is positive, there are two solutions and we use the normal equation.
    2. If the numerator is zero, there is one solution and we use the formula: -b/2a
    3. If the numerator is negative, there are no solutions and do no other calculations

##Calculate the solution for a positive numerator
1. Break up the formula into smaller parts
    1. First we need to find the square root value of b^2-4ac 
    2. Then we would plug in our value of b into the negative sign 
    3. Then plug a into the denominator value  
    4. Because there is a plus and minus sign we could have to figure out both the values 
    5. So then we would plug in all values of a, b and c into the plus portion
    6. Simplify the fraction and solve x
    7. Repeat step f with the minus sign 
    8. In order to find the real roots of x if any   
2. Get the final solution after adding/ multiplying/ dividing the parts together
    1. For the positive calculation we took the ans and sqrt that rather than sqrt the whole equation in order to get similar results 

##Calculate the solution for numerator = 0
1. Use the equation: -b/2a
    1. For the numerator, multiply b with -1.
    2. For the denominator, multiply a with 2
    3. Divide the numerator by the denominator
    4. That is the one solution


##Show the Results
1. If no solutions
    1. Tell them no solutions and display nothing
2. If one solution
    1. Say there is one solution and display it
3. If two solutions
    1. Say there is two solutions and display them

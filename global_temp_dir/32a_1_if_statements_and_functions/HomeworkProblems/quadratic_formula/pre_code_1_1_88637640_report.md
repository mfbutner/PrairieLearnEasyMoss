# My Algorithm (steps to solve the problem)
#Using the quadratic formula
1. Setup the equation that given "ax^2 +bx +c" and "x=-b+- square root(b^2 -4ac)/2a"
2. Calculate the solutions
3. Show the results
    1. Display how many solutions there are (none, 1, or 2)
    2. Display the solution

##Setup the equation
1. Ask for a, b, and c
2. Identify the values of a, b and c 
3. Once a, b and c are defined we plug in into the equation that was given " "x=-b+- square root(b^2 -4ac)/2a"

###Calculate the solutions
1. Break up the formula into smaller parts
    1. First we need to find the square root value of b^2-4ac 
    2. Then we would plug in our value of b into the negative sign 
    3. Then plug a into the denominator value  
    4. Because there is a plus and minus sign we could have to figure out both the values 
    5. So then we would plug in all values of a, b and c into the plus portion
    6. Simplify the fraction and solve x
    7. Repeat step f with the minus sign 
    8. In order to find the real roots of x if any   
2. Get the final solution after adding/ multiplying/ dividing the parts together

####Show the Results
1. If no solutions
    1. Tell them no solutions and display nothing
2. If one solution
    1. Say there is one solution and display it
3. If two solutions
    1. Say there is two solutions and display them

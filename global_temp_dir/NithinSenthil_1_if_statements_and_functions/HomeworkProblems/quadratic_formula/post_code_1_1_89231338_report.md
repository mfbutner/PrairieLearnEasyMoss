# Algorithm (steps to solve the problem)  

# Use Quadratic Solver  
1. Get the quadratic from the user
2. Calculate quadratic solutions
3. Tell user the result

## Get the Quadratic from the User
1. Inform the user of the required format
2. Recieve input

## Calculate qudratic solutions
1. Use values given by the user
2. Calculate the discriminant
    1. If the discriminant is greater than or equal to 0
        1. Use the quadratic equation on the a,b, and c values the user gave
        2. If both of the solutions are the same
            1. you have 1 solution
        3. Otherwise
            1. you have 2 solutions
    2. Otherwise
        1. You have 0 solutions


## Tell User the Result
1. If there are 2 solutions
    1. Say there are 2 solutions
    2. List both solutions
2. If there is 1 solution
    1. Say there is 1 solution
    2. List the solution
3. If there are no solutions
    1. Say there are no solutions

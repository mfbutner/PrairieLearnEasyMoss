# Algorithm (steps to solve the problem)
## Asking for the Variables
1. Let the user know that the form of the equation will be ax^2 + bx + c.
2. Ask for the value of a.
3. Ask for the value of b.
4. Ask for the value of c
5. Send the inputs to the system so it can calculate the solutions and announce the results.

## Create a System to Calculate the Solutions and Announce Results
1. First check if the there were any real solutions by making sure that the calculations under the square root did not result in a number less than 0.
2. If the number was less than 0, it would state that there are no real solutions.
3. If the number was greater than or equal to 0, calculate the solutions using the quadratic formula.
4. Then, I determined whether or not the two solutions were the same number to determine which statement to announce.
5. If they were not the same, it would state that there are two real solutions followed by the solutions, the + solution, then the - solution.
6. If they are the same, then it would state that there is one real solution, followed by the solution.

# Differences
* In my original solution, I did not state how I would check if there are no real solutions.
* Also, I did not state that I would create a system where it would calculate the solutions and state the results using the inputs that were asked for.

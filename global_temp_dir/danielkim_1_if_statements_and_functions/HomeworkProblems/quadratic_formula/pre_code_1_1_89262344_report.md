# My Algorithm (steps to solve the problem
## Asking for the Variables
1. Let the user know that the form of the equation will be ax^2 + bx + c.
2. Ask for the value of a.
3. Ask for the value of b.
4. Ask for the value of c
## Calculating the Solutions
1. Use the quadratic formula to calculate the solutions.
2. First calculate -b + the sqare root of (b^2 - 4ac). Then, divide that by 2 * a.
3. Then, calculate -b - the sqare root of (b^2 - 4ac). Then, divide that by 2 * a.
## Stating the Solutions
1. Based on the number of real solutions that wre calculated, state the number of real solutions followed by the solutions starting with the + solution, then the - solution.
2. If there are no real solutions, state that there are no real solutions.

# Algorithm (steps to solve the problem)

##How I actually solved the problem

1. I had to know the quadratic formula and the different approaches/options (plus/minus). Technically, I had to know two not so different equations. ( -b +/- sqrt(b^2 - 4*a*c)) / 2*a

2. Another crucial thing I had to take into consideration was the order in which I solved the equation. Doing so, kept me organized and it was easy to see where I was within the equation. 

3. I began by finding the results of the discriminant (numbers within the square root). Then I applied the square root.

4. From here on, I continue to combine the numbers within the numerator. I add negative b to the results of the square root.

5. I then multiply the 2 and a. 

6. Finally, I divide the numerator by the denominator. This will give me the first answer.

7. I repeat the same exact steps, except this time, at step 4, I subtract the result of the square root from -b. 

8. Now that we know the steps, we can get numbers and start calculating. 

9. If the result from within the square root were 0, we'd know that there is one answer, two if the results were more than 0, and no real answer if it was less than 0. 

# Differences

1. I did not leave my answer unsimplified. 

2. I walk through the steps of solving this equation before plugging in numbers.

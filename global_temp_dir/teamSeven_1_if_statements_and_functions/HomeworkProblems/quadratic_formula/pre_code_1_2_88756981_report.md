##Requirements
1. In order to use the formula, we'll need 3 variables; a, b, and c. With these, we'll be able to substitute numbers into the formula. 

##Formula Needed
1. The formula we'll use is -b plus/minus the square root of b squared - 4*a*c, divided by 2a. It'll look like this, (-b +/- sqrt(b^2 - 4ac) ) / 2a .

##Steps to solving the problem
1. Once we have the numbers for each variable (a, b, and c), we can substitute each number into its variable within the equation. 

2. After substituting, we'll start with the values within the square root, b^2 - 4*a*c. If the result is square root-able, apply the square root. If not, do not apply the square root and leave as is.

3. If the square root was applied, add or subtract from -b (we're working in the numerator). Repeat this step using the other expression, you chose not to use the first time. If the square root was applied, leave the numerator as is. 

4. Finally divide the numerator by 2*a and you'll get the answer to the quadratic formula. If the numerator was left as is, multiply 2 and a (the denominator), and leave the answer as it is.

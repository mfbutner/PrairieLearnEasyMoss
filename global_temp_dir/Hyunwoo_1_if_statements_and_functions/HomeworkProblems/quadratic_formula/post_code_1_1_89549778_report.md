# Algorithm (steps to solve the problem)
##Start Program
1. Setup program
2. Start program

##Setup Program
1. Define variables a, b, c
2. Output text asking user to input a
3. Assign variable a to input
4. Output text asking user to input b
5. Assign variable b to input
6. Output text asking user to input c
7. Assign variable c to input

##Run Program
1. Define 0 solution variables and output if a is 0 or b^2 - 2ac is less than 0
2. Output that there are no solutions
3. Define 2 solution variables if b^2 - 2ac is not 0
4. Input variables a, b, c into quadratic formula and output result
5. Define 1 solution variables if not 0 or 2 solutions
6. Input variables a, b, c into quadratic formula and output result

# Differences
* I changed the requirements for having no solutions, included b^2 - 2ac is less than 0
* Worded how to output no solutions separately from the one or two outputs

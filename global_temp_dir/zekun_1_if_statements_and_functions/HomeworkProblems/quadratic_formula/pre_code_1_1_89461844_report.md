#display the roots of eqautions
1. set up the formula
2. give feedback

## set up the formula
1. asking people to enter the numbers that equal to a, b and c. 
    // a, b, and c are the constant numbers in the equation of a*x^2+b*x+c 
    // a could not be 0 
2. use b^2-4*a*c to determine the number of roots
3. using the root of quadratic equation to get the roots 

## give feedback
1. when b^2-4*a*c is greater than 0, using quadratic equation we should have two roots
2. when b^2-4*a*c is equal to 0, using quadratic equation we can have one root
3. when b^2-4*a*c is less than 0, using quadratic equation we can not get any roots

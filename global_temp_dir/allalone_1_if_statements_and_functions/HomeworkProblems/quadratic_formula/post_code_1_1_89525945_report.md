# Steps to use the quadratic equation
1. Write out the quadratic equation
2. Add values to the mathematical variables (a , b, c)
3. Calculate the discriminant
4. Calculate the solution of the plugged in mathematical variable digits

## Write out the quadratic equation
1. A quadratic equation is in the form ax^2 + bx + c.
2. The quadratic equation to find the roots of x are in the form -b plus or minus 
the square root of b^2-4ac which is then all completely divided by 2a.

## Add values to the mathematical variables (a,b,c)
1. The mathematical variables are "a", "b", and "c".
2. You plug in any real numbers, including those with decimal points, and "a" cannot equal to zero.

## Calculate the discriminant to see how many solutions there are
1. The equation for the discriminant is b^2 - 4 times a times c.
2. If the discriminant is less than zero there are no real solutions.
3. If the discriminant is equal to zero there is one real solution.
4. If the discriminant is greater than zero there are two real solutions.

## Calculate the solution of the plugged in mathematical variable digits
1. There could be differing amounts of solutions, those being either no solutions, one solution, or two solutions.
2. If there are two solutions, write the addition solution first.
3. The solutions will show two decimal points when written.

# Algorithm (steps to solve the problem)
## Solving Quadratic Equation
## 1. Setup Equation
## 2. Solve Equation


# Setup Equation
  * 1. Provide quadratic equation format
  * 2. Recive quadratic equation with values

# Solve Equation
  * 1. Identify quadratic equation values
    *  Find a, b, and c
  * 2. Plug in values to quadratic equation (plus)
  * 3. Plug in values to quadratic equation (minus)
  * 4. Check the value under the sqrt symbol
    * If the value is equal too zero 
        * There is one solution
    * If the value is less than zero
        * There are no solutions
    * Otherwise there are two solutions
  
# Differences
##### The main differences between the original system and the finished product is the process in determining how many solutions there are. It required more steps than I previously anticipated and took time to figure out. A slight reorder was the only other difference

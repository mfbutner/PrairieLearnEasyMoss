# My Algorithm (steps to solve the problem)
# Solving Quadratic Equation
## 1. Setup Equation
## 2. Solve Equation


# Setup Equation
  * 1. Provide quadratic equation format
  * 2. Recive quadratic equation with values

# Solve Equation
  * 1. Identify quadratic equation values
    *  Find a, b, and c
  * 2. Plug in values to quadratic equation (plus)
    * If there is a solution
        *  There is one solution
    * Otherwise there are no solutions
  * 3. Plug in values to quadratic equation (minus)
    * If there is a solution
        * There is one solution
    * Otherwise there are no solutions
  * 4. If there are solutions two both equations there are two solutions

# Algorithm (steps to solve the problem)
##Setup the Formula
1. Ask the user for the number values a, b, and c given a quadratic equation of the form ax^2 + bx
+c.

## Plug given values into the Quadratic Formula 
1. Plug the given a, b, and c values into the quadratic formula which is x = -b +- square root of 
b^2 - 4ac divided by 2a.

##For possible roots of x 
    1.After the a,b, and c values have been plugged into the quadratic formula, in the event that there are one or two x values that means there are one or two real solutions to the equation and the solution(s) will be shown on the screen as well as how many solution(s) there are. 

##For no possible roots of x 
    1.After the a,b, and c values have been plugged into the quadratic formula, in the event that there are no x values that means there are no real solutions to the equation and the phrase "There are no real solutions" will be shown on the screen.

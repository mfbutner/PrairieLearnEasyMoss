# My Algorithm (steps to solve the problem)
## Figuring out the portions of the quadratic equation
1.)First you will need to know what will be your numbers for the equation -b+- square root of b^2-4ac all divided by 2a. You would need to figure out what number will be your a b and c
##Using the equation

1.) You will now input the numbers that you have chosen for your constants into the equation and calculate the results
        
        1b.) The recommended way of solving the is by spillting it into two portions
        2b.) separate the b +- portion from the more complex portion
        3b.) calculate the more complex portion
        4b.) now reformat the eqn to enter b+- to your new result in order to get the final answer
        
2.) Get your final answers from the equation
## Interpreting the results
1.) Use b+- on your final equation

2.) Find the amount of real solutions
        
        2a) Any square root with a negative on the inside is not a real solution

3.)Now you have finished using the equation to find your real roots

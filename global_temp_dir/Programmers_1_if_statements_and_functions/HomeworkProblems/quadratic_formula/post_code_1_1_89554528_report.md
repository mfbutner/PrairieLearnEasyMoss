# Finding the a,b,c
First I had to figure out what a,b,c I would need to use for my quadratic equation ax+bx+c=0
once i figured out the input i then used the quadratic formula

##Using the quadratic formula
1)What I did was I used the discrminant formula b^2-4ac to determine how many solutions the question had. This is a new element that I added to my original solving plan. I had to make this change in order to determine which equation to use in our final answer

2) Knowing whether or not there were 2 solutions, one solution, or no solutions helped alot. The answer of the equation from above if greater than zero would have 2 real solution and if equal to zero it would have one real solution and if neither it would have no real solutions. Knowing the real solutions is another change from the original with the change made to make the imgainary numbers unecssary in solving the quadratic.

3)From there we would apply our square root and divison by 2 a to the equation. The discrimanant would tell us whether or no to add b or to subtract it
##Getting the solution
Once the solution was gathered you would make sure the discrminant formula was followed and check the solution if there is one at all. Now you have the reall roots to the quadratic formula you were trying to solve!

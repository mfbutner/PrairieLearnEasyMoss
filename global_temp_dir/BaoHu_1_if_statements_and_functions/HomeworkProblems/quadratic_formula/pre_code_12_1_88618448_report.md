# My Algorithm (steps to solve the problem)
Find the solution(s) of a quadratic equation
1. Complete the equation (get the values of a,b and c)
2. Calculation
3. Show the solution(s)

# Complete the equation:
1. Inform user the standard form of the quadratic equation, so they know what are a, b and c stand for.
2. Prompt user to enter their numbers, the cooeficents.

# Calculation:
1. Determine how many solution(s) we have, 0, 1 or 2.
    - Find the value of (b^2 -4ac) which is the part under the square root sign.
    - Compare it with 0 to determine the number of solutions we may have.
2. Perform the quadratic formula.
    - When it's the case that there are 2 solutions, find these 2 solutions.
    - When it's the case that there are 1 solutions, find that 1 solution.
    - When there is no solution, just jump to the "Show the solution(s)" part.
# Show the solution(s):
1. When there is no solution, tell user there is no solution.
2. When there is 1 solution, tell user there is 1 solution and show it on the screen.
3. When there are 2 solutions, tell user there are 2 solutions and show it on the screen.

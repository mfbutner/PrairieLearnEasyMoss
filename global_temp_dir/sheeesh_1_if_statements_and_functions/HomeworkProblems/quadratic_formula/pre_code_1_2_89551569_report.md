# My Algorithm (steps to solve the problem)

##Get the values of a,b,c
1. Ask the user values of a,b and c in the quadratic equation's standard form ax^2 + bx + c
2. Write it down in standard form

##Checking value of determinant
#####Determinant formula is (b^2 - 4ac)
1. Substituting the value of a,b and c in this formula
2. If the determinant is greater than or equal to 0 we compute the value of the roots
3. If the determinant is lesser than 0 then we tell the user that the roots are imaginary and cannot be computed

##Substitute into equation
#####Quadratic formula is (-b +/- sqrt(b^2 - 4ac)) / (2a) where the symbol +- represents "plus or minus"
1. Substitute values of a, b and c under the square root i.e. [?](b^2 - 4ac) and solve 
2. First add -b to the above solved value
3. Divide the above value by 2*a to find the first root
4. Subtract the value from step 1 from -b 
5. Divide value of number 4 by 2*a to find

##Giving the answer
1. Inform the user the values of the roots

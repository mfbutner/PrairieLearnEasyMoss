# Algorithm (steps to solve the problem)

### Ask the user for the values of a, b, and c
- Tell them to use the standard form (ax^2 + bx + c) as a template for their understanding
- Use all the information down below to give them an answer

### Find the number of solutions to the quadratic function
- Find the discriminant
- If the discriminant is greater than 0, there are 2 solutions
- If the discriminant is equal to 0, there is 1 solution
- If the discriminant is lesser than 0, there are no solutions
- Tell the user the number of solutions
- Using this information, find the value of the solutions for the function

### Find the first solution of the quadratic function
- This will be the + solution from the quadratic formula
- Use the quadratic formula to find the root
- Keep in mind, you don't need to do this if there are no solutions
- Tell the user the answer

### Find the second solution of the quadratic function
- This will be the - solution from the quadratic formula
- Use the quadratic formula to find the root
- Keep in mind, you don't need to do this if there is only 1 solution
- Tell the user the answer

# Differences
- I changed the order of the steps to represent how I would solve the problem if I didn't have to write a program that solved it.
- Writing my first explanation, I was thinking about the types of functions I needed because I was eager to solve the problem. In retrospect, I realized that a person with no coding experience wouldn't comprehend that.
- This explanation resembles a natural human thought process instead of an outline for a C program.

# Algorithm

## Solve a quadratic equation using the quadratic formula
1. Use the formula ((-b +- sqrt(b^2 - 4*ac)) / (2*a).

## Make sure the equation is in the correct form
1. Quadratic equations are in the form (ax^2 + bx + c).
2. Get this information from the user.

## Find the discriminant
1. The discriminant can be solved for using the equation (b^2 - 4ac).

## Check for the number of solutions
1. If the discriminant is positive or zero, the quadratic formula can be used to solve for the solution(s). Move onto the final step.
2. If the discriminant is negative, there are no real solutions to the quaratic equation.

## Calculate for the solutions using the quadratic formula and the values from the quadratic equation
1. Solution 1 = (-b + sqrt(b^2 - 4ac)) / (2a).
1. Solution 2 = (-b - sqrt(b^2 - 4ac)) / (2a).
    * note: if the disciminant from the previous step was 0, the two solutions will be equal.

# Differences

* I did not need to check to make sure the equation was in the correct form as that was quaranteed in the user input.

## Solve a quadratic equation
1. Use the quadratic formula (-b +- sqrt(b^2 - 4*ac)) / (2a).

## Use correct values from the equation
1. Quadratic equations are in the form ax^2+bx+c.
2. If your equation is ordered differently, make sure to reorganize it into this form.
    * The hanging constant is the c value.
    * The constant attached to a single x is the b value.
    * The constant attached to x^2 is the a value.
3. Get this information from the user.

## Find the discriminant
1. Calculate the discrimant using the formula (b^2 - 4*ac)

## Check for the amount of solutions
1. If the discriminant is positive, or zero, the quadratic forumula can be used to find the solution, continue to the final step.
2. If the discriminant is negative, there is no real solution to the given quadratic equation.

## Plug a, b, and c values to the quadratic formula and solve
1. Solution 1 = (-b + sqrt(b^2 - 4*ac)) / (2a).
1. Solution 2 = (-b - sqrt(b^2 - 4*ac)) / (2a).
    * note: if the discriminant from the step above was zero, solution 1 and 2 will be equal

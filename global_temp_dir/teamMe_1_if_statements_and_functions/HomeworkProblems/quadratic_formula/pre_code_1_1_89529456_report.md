# My Algorithm (steps to solve the problem)
## input stage: 
1) The user will write 3 inputs for each value of the equation
## calculation stage: 
1)the program will use the 3 inputs to form an answer to be sent back. 
2)If the inside of the parenthesis in the quadratic equation is less than zero, then the program will compute that value to zero since it has no roots. 
3)This will be done twice, once to add and once to subtract to find both roots.
##print stage: 
4)The program will read each value and determine what it is going to print. 
5)If the program has no roots, one root, or two unique roots, then it will type something different

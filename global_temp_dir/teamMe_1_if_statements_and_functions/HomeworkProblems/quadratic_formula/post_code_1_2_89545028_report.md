# Algorithm (steps to solve the problem)
##Input stage: 
1)get the suer to type in inputs and store those values
2)Ask the quesitons necessary to get the right input ex: what is a?
##Calculation stage:
1)use the three numbers from earlier and run it through the formula
2)If the inside of the square root is less than zero stop there because that means there are no roots
3)Run it twice, one with addition and one with subtraction
#Print stage:
1)Depending on the value of the answers to say different words
2)if it is zero, then there are no solutons
3)If they are the same number than there is 1 solution
4)If there are 2 different numbers then there are 2
# Differences
1)had to make sure to absolute value the difference of the answers so that a negative answer will not mess you up
2)Had to make sure that the inputs could be any number

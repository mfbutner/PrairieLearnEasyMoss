# My Algorithm (steps to solve the problem)

Setup:
I will ask the user to type in the a, b, and c of their quadratic equation

Calculations:
I will calculate the discriminant using the discriminant formula and save the value
After calculating the discriminant I will calculate the roots if the discriminant is greater than or equal to 0

Display:
If the discriminant is greater than 0 I will display on the screen that there are two real solution
If the discriminant is equal to 0 I will display that there is one real solution
If the discriminant is less than 0 I will display that there are no solution
I will then display the roots if the discriminant was greater than or equal to 0

# Quadratic Equation
1. Choose number values for first equation
2. Use those values for the second equation and solve for x
## Setting Up The First Equation
1. The quadratic equation ax^2+bx+c can be used to solve for x in problems that are unable to be factored. Given this,
    1. Choose a number for a
    2. Choose a number for b
    3. Choose a number for c
## The Discriminant
1. Using the equation for the discriminant, which is b^2 - 4ac, you can determine if the solution will have 0, 1, or  2 solutions. You will plug in your previously chosen values into this equation. This will be essential in determining if you need to continue to the next step and use the quadratic formula.
## Zero Solutions
1. Using the equation for the discriminant, which is b^2 - 4ac, you can determine if the solution will have 0, 1, or  2 solutions. You will plug in your previously chosen values into this equation. This will be essential in determining if you need to continue to the next step and use the quadratic formula.
## One Real Solution
1. Your answer will have one real solution if the discriminant is equal to 0. You can continue to the next step and use the quadratic formula.
## Two Real Solutions
1. Your answer will have two real solutions if the discriminant is greater than 0.
## Setting Up The Second Equation
1. Once you have the values for a, b, and c you can utilize the second quadratic formula 
    1. Plug in the values for a, b, and c into the second equation.
     $$
        x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}
        $$
    2. Now you can solve for x to determine your solution(s).

# Differences
1. There were a few differences between the original and current solution.
    * n this current solution, the discriminant was first established.
    * It is emphasized that the discriminant needs to be solved for first in order to determine whether there will be zero, one, or two solutions.
    * In this current solution, it is made clear that you are given your final answer if you solve for the discriminant and your answer is less than 0, resulting in 0 solutions and saving time.

# Quadratic Equation
1. Choose number values for first equation
2. Use those values for the second equation and solve for x
## Setting up the first equation
1. The quadratic equation ax2+bx+c can be used to solve for x in problems that are unable to be factored. Given this,
    1. Choose a number for a
    2. Choose a number for b
    3. Choose a number for c

## Setting up the second equation
1. Once you have the values for a, b, and c you can utilize the second quadratic formula.
    1. Plug in the values for a, b, and c into the second equation: 
        $$
        x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}
        $$
    2. Now you can solve for x
### Equation solutions
    1. Your equation should either have 0, 1, or 2 solution(s). 
#### Zero solutions
    1. Your answer will have zero solutions if the discriminant (b2-4ac) is less than 0.
#### One real solution
    1. Your answer will have one real solution if the discriminant is equal to 0.
#### Two real solutions
    1. Your answer will have two real solutions if the discriminant is greater than 0.

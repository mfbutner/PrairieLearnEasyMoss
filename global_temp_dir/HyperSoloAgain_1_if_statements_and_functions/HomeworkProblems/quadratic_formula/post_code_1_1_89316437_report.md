# How to Solve the Quadratic Equation

## Solve Quadratic Equation
1. Determine coefficients
2. Checking Available Solutions
2. Using the Quadratic Equation

## Determine coefficients
1. Request for the coefficient to the x squared term
2. Record and store the coefficient as a
1. Request for the coefficient to the x term
2. Record and store the coefficient as b
1. Request for the coefficient to the term without x
2. Record and store the coefficient as c

## Checking Available
1. Compute terms under square root
2. If the result is negative, skip straight to step 7 of Using the Quadratic Equation

## Using the Quadratic Equation
1. Compute the Square Root
2. Assign a Plus/Minus
3. Multiply the coefficient b with negative one
4. Sum the results in steps 2 and 3
5. Divide the result of step 4 by a value of 2, then by the coefficient a
6. Determine Number of Solutions
7. Display the Result(s)

## Compute the Square Root
1. Does the math from Checking Available

## Assign a Plus/Minus
1. Assign the result from Compute the Square Root to be positive for a variable
2. Assign the result from Compute the Square Root to be positive for another

## Determine Number of Solutions
1. Compare the two results from Assign a Plus/Minus
2. If both are the same solution, then we will only present one solution 

## Display the Result(s)
1. If Compute the Square Root is negative, there are no real solutions; otherwise, display the number of solutions from Determine Number of Solutions

# Difference
1. Introduce a step to check if there is a solution or not (Checking Available)
2. Modified Compute the Square Root since Checking Available does a part of its original function
3. Modified Assign a Plus/Minus to not depend on Determine Number of Solutions
4. Modified Determine Number of Solutions to not recall Assign a Plus/Minus
5. Modified Display the Result(s) based on difference 3 and 4

# How to Solve the Quadratic Equation

## Solve Quadratic Equation
1. Determine coefficients
2. Using the Quadratic Equation

## Determine coefficients
1. Request for the coefficient to the x squared term
2. Record and store the coefficient as a
1. Request for the coefficient to the x term
2. Record and store the coefficient as b
1. Request for the coefficient to the term without x
2. Record and store the coefficient as c

## Using the Quadratic Equation
1. Compute the Square Root
2. Assign a Plus/Minus
3. Multiply the coefficient b with negative one
4. Sum the results in steps 2 and 3
5. Divide the result of step 4 by a value of 2, then by the coefficient a
6. Determine Number of Solutions
7. Display the Result(s)

## Compute the Square Root
1. Square the coefficient b
2. Find the product of 4, the coefficient a, and the coefficient c
3. Subtract step 2 from step 1
4. If the result is negative, skip straight to step 7 of Using the Quadratic Equation
5. Takes the square root of the result

## Assign a Plus/Minus
1. Assign the result from Compute the Square Root to be positive
2. If Determine Number of Solutions finds two solutions, set to negative

## Determine Number of Solutions
1. Take result from Compute the Square Root
2. If the result is non-zero, there are 2 solutions and jump back to step 2 of Using the Quadratic Equation

## Display the Result(s)
1. If Compute the Square Root is negative, there are no real solutions
2. If Determine Number of Solutions did not jump back to step 2 of Using the Quadratic Equation, display the solution
3. If Determine Number of Solution jump back to step 2 of Using the Quadratic Equation, display both solutions

How to Solve Quadratic Formula
    1. Get values for a, b, and c 
    2. Plug a, b, c into the quadratic formula to get solutions 
Get Values for a, b , and c
    1. from user input 
Plug a, b, and c into quadratic formula 
    1. given the formula x = (-b +- sqrt(b^2 - 4*a*c)) / 2*a
    2. Split the formula into different steps 
    3. Evaluate -b
    4. evaluate b^2 which is b*b
    5. evaluate 4*a*c
    6. evaluate step 4 minus step 5
    7. take the square root of step 6
    8. evaluate 2*a
Solve for 2 solutions
    Solve for postive solution
        1. evaluate -b 
        2. obtain answer in step 7 (in plug a,b,c into quadratic formula)
        3. evaluate step 1 plus step 2
        4. divide step 3 by 2*a
        5. Obtain answer
    Solve for negative solution 
        1. evaluate -b
        2. obtain answer in step 7 (in plug a,b,c into quadratic formula)
        3. evalaute step 1 minus step 2
        4. divide step 3 by 2*a
        5. obstain answer 
Solve for one solution
    1. if b^2 equal 4*a*c
    2. there will be one solution
Solve for no solution
    1. if b^2 is less than 4*a*c
    2. there will be no solution

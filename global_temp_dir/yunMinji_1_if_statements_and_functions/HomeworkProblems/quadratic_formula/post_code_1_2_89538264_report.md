# Algorithm (new steps)
## Formula used (given)
$$
x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}
$$

## Steps
1. Arrange your equation into the form of: 
$$ax^2 + bx + c = 0$$
2. Take the coefficients **a**, **b**, **c** and *substitute* them into the quadratic formula (given above)

3. Simplify and solve for x
    1. Solve for the *inside of the squareroot* first **(b*b - 4*a*c)**
    2. If the inside
        + equals zero, only one solution exists, so go ahead and solve it right away
        + is bigger than 0, there are two solutions, solve for both
        + is smaller than 0, there are no solutions, so stop the calculation

## Differences from old steps
1. Steps 1 and 2 above were the same
2. Step 3 above became more detailed. Solved for the inside of the squareroot to find how many possible answers exist. If there was no possible solution, stopped the computation to prevent wasting time.

# How to solve quadratic equations by using the quadratic formula 
$$ $$
## Formula used (given)
$$
x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}
$$

## Basics
* **Any numbers** (even imaginary numbers) can be used as **x**
* The **coefficients** (a, b, c) should be **real numbers** 
* **a $\not=$ 0**


## Steps
1. Arrange your equation into the form of: 
$$ax^2 + bx + c = 0$$
2. Take the coefficients **a**, **b**, **c** and *substitute* them into the quadratic formula (given above)

3. Simplify and solve for x

* You can check if the solutions are right by substituting them back into the equation and solving it

* You may get **0, 1 or 2 solutions** depending on the values of a, b, c

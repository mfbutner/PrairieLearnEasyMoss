# My Algorithm (steps to solve the problem)

##Get quadratic equation from user in the form ax^2+bx+c
-Extract a, b, and c as variables

-If the user inputs something that isn't in that form, then tell user it is an invalid input
##Calculate the real roots of x
-Use the quadratic equation twice (positive and negative version)

-For both iterations of the calculation, if the number in the square root of the formula is negative, then it is not considered a solution

##Tell the user all solutions
-If it is positive, then it is printed first; If there are none, tell the user that there are none

# Algorithm (steps to solve the problem)
1. Get user input for the values for a,b,c
2. Calculate the discriminant to determine the number of solutions 
2.1 negative discriminant is no real solutions
2.2 discriminant equal to zero is one real solutions
2.3 discriminant is positive is equal to two real solutions
3. Calculate solutions using the quadratic formula
4. Tell the user the number of real solutions and what the real solutions are. 

# Differences from what I thought I had to do before completing the assignment
1. There were no changes in terms of how to approach the assignment, but the code did end up needing to be more complex than I had thought.

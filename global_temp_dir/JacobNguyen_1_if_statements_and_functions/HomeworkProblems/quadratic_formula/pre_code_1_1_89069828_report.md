## Solve Quadratic Equation
    1. Get Input
    2. Get Solutions
    3. Say How Many Solutions There Were
    
## Get Input
    1. Get a, b, and c
    2. a will be the coefficient of the first term of the quadratic equation
    3. b will be the coefficient of the second term of the quadratic equation
    4. c will be the third term of the quadratic equation
    
## Get Solutions
    1. Before plugging the input into the quadratic formula, first plug the input into the square root part of the quadratic formula
    2. on the condition that the answer is positive
        a. the answer is a real solution
    3. on the condition that the answer is negative
        a. the answer is not a real solution
    4. on the condition that the answer is a real solution
        a. plug the input into the quadratic formula to get the solution
        
## Say How Many Solutions There Were
    1. say how many real solutions there are
    2. say all real solutions to the quadratic equation

# Calculate the roots of a quadratic equation
1. Get user input for a, b, and c
2. Find the roots of the quadratic equation
3. Display the results
## Get user input
1. Ask user for a, b, and c
## Find the roots of the quadratic equation
1. First find b^2 -4ac. If the result is negative there are no real solution, and the problem is solved
2. Squareroot b^2-4ac
3. Add -b to the result of step 2. This will be the first possible root
4. Subtract -b from the result of step 2. This will be the second possible root. 
5. Divide both possible roots by 2a.
6. If both possible roots are the same number, there is only one root. Otherwise there are 2 roots
## Display the ressults
1. Say if there are 0, 1, or 2 roots
2. Display all possible roots if neccesary

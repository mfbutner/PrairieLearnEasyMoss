# Calculating solutions to a quadratic equation using the quadratic formula
##1. Tell the user to provide numbers in the format ax^2 + bx + c 
1. Let the user enter their first number, a, and record it.
2. Let the user enter their second number, b, and record it.
3. Let the user enter their third number, c, and record it.
##2. Check first the value of the square root of b minus 4 times a times c is less than 0.
1. If it is less than 0, then the problem has 0 real solutions. Display this to the user.
2. If it is 0, then the problem has 1 real solution: -b divided by 2 times a. Display this to the user.
3. If it is greater than 0, proceed.
##3. Finding 2 solutions
1. Calculate the first solution using -b PLUS the square root of b squared minus 4 times a times c. Everything is divided by 2 times a.
2. Calculate the second solution using -b MINUS the square root of b squared minus 4 times a times c. Everything is divided by 2 times a.
3. Display that the problem has 2 real solutions, and display both solutions calculated in steps 3 and 4.

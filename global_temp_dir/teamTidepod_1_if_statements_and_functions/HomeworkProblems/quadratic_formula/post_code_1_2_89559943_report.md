# Differences 

###1. Use the discriminant formula b times b minus 4 times a times c to check the value
        1. If discriminant is less than 0, there are no real solutions 
        1. If it equals 0, then the problem has 1 real solution: -b divided by 2 times a.
        1. If it is greater than 0, the problem has two real solutions
            1. Calculate the first solution using -b PLUS the square root of b squared minus 4 times a times c. Everything is divided by 2 times a.
            1. Calculate the second solution using -b MINUS the square root of b squared minus 4 times a times c. Everything is divided by 2 times a.
        
###1. Tell the user to provide numbers in the format ax^2 + bx + c 
1. Let the user enter their first number, a, and record it.
2. Let the user enter their second number, b, and record it.
3. Let the user enter their third number, c, and record it.

###3. Check first the value of the square root of b minus 4 times a times c is less than 0.
1. If it is greater than 0, the problem has two real solutions
    1. Display that the problem has 2 real solutions, and display both solutions calculated.
2. If it is equal to 0, the problem has one real solution 
    1. Display the one solution that was calculated
3. Display that there are no real solutions.

* I changed the order in which I wrote the real solutions. I initially said I'd start off by asking users for their values and then write about the math of finding real solutions but I started writing the math first and then recieved input from the users. I found that easier to organize in my code.

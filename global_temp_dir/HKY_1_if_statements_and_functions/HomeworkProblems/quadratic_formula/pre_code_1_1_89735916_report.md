##Ask the user what the numbers (a, b, c) are
##Calculate the result
1. Check to see how many solutions there are
    1. Check if there's no solutions, by checking whether b^2 - 4ac is greater than or equal to zero (i.e. if the square root is going to produce a valid result)
    2. Check if there's only one solution, by checking whether -b + sqrt(b^2 - 4ac) is equal to -b - sqrt(b^2 - 4ac) (i.e. if the results are the same)
    3. If neither of the above are the case, there's two solutions
2. Calculate the results, if they exist
    1. Use the formula once if there's one solution
    2. Use the formula twice if there's two solutions, once with a plus sign, and the other with a minus sign
        1. Check to see which is greater, and put that one at the front

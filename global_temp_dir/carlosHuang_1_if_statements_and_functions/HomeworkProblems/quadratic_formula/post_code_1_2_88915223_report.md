# My Algorithm (steps to solve the problem)

#Using the quadratic formula
    1. pick the quadractic formula
    2. ensure the format is in ax^2 + bx + c, where a is not 0.

##Determine your coeficients.
    1. find out what a, b and c are.
##Find your discriminant
    1. square b
    2. multiply four by a and then b repesctively.
    3. subtract the result of step 1 by the result of step 2.
    4. square root the result of step 3.
##Is the discriminant a real number.
    when discriminant is less than 0, then it is not a real number.
##Find your two x values.
    ###frist x value.
        1. negate b.
        2. add the result of step 1 by the discriminant.
        3. divide the result of step 2 by two times a.
    ###Secound x value.
        1. negate b.
        2. subtract the result of step 1 by the discriminant.
        3. divide the result of step 2 by two times a.
##Dertermine when the x values are real:
    1. the answer does not contain i, which equals to sqrt(-1).
# Differences 
#I mainly had to use the discriminant as a condition to check the number of solutions, which I did not think when writing out my solutions. As shown bellow:

    ##Find your discriminant!!
    1. square b
    2. multiply four by a and then b repesctively.
    3. subtract the result of step 1 by the result of step 2.
## when discriminant is bigger than 0, then there are 2 solutions to be found.
    ###Find your two x values.
        ####frist x value.
            1. negate b.
            2. add the result of step 1 by the squre root of discriminant.
            3. divide the result of step 2 by 2 times a.
        ###Secound x value.
            1. negate b.
            2. subtract the result of step 1 by the square root of discriminant.
            3. divide the result of step 2 by two times a.
            
## when discriminant is equal to 0, there is one solutions to be found.
    ### Nothing can be conclude.
    ### the formula will produce imaginary numbers.

## when discriminant is less than 0, there is no solution to be found.
     ###Find your only solution:
            1. negate b.
            2. add the result of step 1 by the squre root of discriminant.
            3. divide the result of step 2 by 2 times a.

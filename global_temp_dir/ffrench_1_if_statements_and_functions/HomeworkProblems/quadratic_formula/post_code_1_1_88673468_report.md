# Algorithm (steps to solve the problem)
1. Get user input 
2. Compute the roots
3. Sort and output results

## Get user input
1. Ask the user for the a, b, and c values of a quadratic function

## Compute the real roots of the quadratic
1. Substitute a, b, & c into the quadratic equation and solve
2. Split the computation into two parts with one part solving for minus the square root of b^2 - 4ac and one part for plus the square root of b^2 - 4ac

## Sort and output results
1. If there is one root that is a real number output that root
2. If there are two roots that are real numbers output both roots
3. If there are no real roots output that there are no real roots
4. If both computations result in the same root there is only one real root

# Differences
- Getting and formatting the users input was easier because the program only asks for a, b, and c rather than the entire quadratic formula
- Sorting and outputting the results was more difficult than expected.
- Hopefully the formatting of this is better because I understand Markdown syntax better

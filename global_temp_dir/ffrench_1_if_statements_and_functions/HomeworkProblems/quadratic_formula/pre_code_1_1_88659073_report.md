## Find the Real Roots
1. Get user input 
2. Compute the roots
3. Output results

##Get user input
1. Ask the user for an equation in the format ax^2 + bx + c.
2. Break down the equation entered into a, b, and c.

## Compute the real roots of the quadratic
1. Substitute a, b, & c into the quadratic equation.
2. Split the computation into two parts with one part solving for minus the square root b^2-4ac and one part for plus the square root of b^2-4ac.
3. If the computations result in real numbers they are real roots.
4.  Disregard the roots that are not real numbers.

## Output results
1. Display the real roots to the user.
2. If there are no real roots tell the user there are no real roots.

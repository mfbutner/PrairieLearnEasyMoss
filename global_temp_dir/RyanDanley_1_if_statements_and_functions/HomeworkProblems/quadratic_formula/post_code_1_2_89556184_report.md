#Disclaimer:
I misinterpeted the one time submittal on the Markdown description of our assignment to mean that I could only submit the code itself once. This means that--while the Markdown description of the problem is the one I had in mind from the outset--I was cleaning up the Markdown text as I was writing my code to make the two more cohesive. As such, both my assessment of the task as well as my final code have little deviation. However, I nonetheless ran into multiple problems in my attempt to solve the problem.

#Problems:
##Problem 1:
I couldn't find a way to pass the information from the first function onto the second function.
##Solution:
Googling this led me to a Stack Overflow post about pointers. Implementing them was a bit tricky but I got it down after a few tries.
##Problem 2:
Despite testing my code extensively, I was surprised to find that it didn't work on the first submission. I made some minor tweaking that didn't really do anything but figured might work, and still no result.
##Solution:
After parsing line by line between my code and the desired output, I realized that what I had written as "ax^2" in the first printed message, the assignment wanted as "a*x^2". After fixing this, the assignment submitted with no issue.

# Algorithm (steps to solve the problem)
## Ask user for values of a, b,c
1. what is a
2. what is b
3. what is c
## Use the equation of quadratic formula
1. assign inputs to components of formula
1. finding the roots - use discriminants
# Differences
## if the discriminant is over 0
1. calculate the roots
2. gives 2 real solutions 
## if the discriminant is equal to 0
1. calculate the root by equating them
2. gives 1 root only
### any other result will give no real soltuion

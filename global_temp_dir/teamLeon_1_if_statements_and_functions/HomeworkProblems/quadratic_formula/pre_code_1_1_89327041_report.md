# My Algorithm (steps to solve the problem)
##Quadratic Formula
1. Give the user the quadratic form which is ax^2+bx + c
2. Ask the user for three numbers
3. Put three numbers into a,b,c
##Setting up Formula
1. First solve for under the radical
2. multuply the value for b by itself and subtract by 4 multiplied by the product of a and c
    1. If the the number under the radical ends up to be negative
    2. Tell the user that there are no real solutions
3. Take the sqaure root of the values after multiplying
    1. First Take that answer and subtract it from the negative value of b
    2. Divide that answer by 2 times a
    3. Also take that answer but add it from the negative value of b
    4. also divide that answer by 2 times a 
4. If both answers are the same number then tell the user there is one solution and list it

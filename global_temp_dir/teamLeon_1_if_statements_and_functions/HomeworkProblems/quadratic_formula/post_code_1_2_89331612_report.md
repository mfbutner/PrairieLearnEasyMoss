# Algorithm (steps to solve the problem)
1. I first took the three numbers the user inputed and solved for whats under the radical(b^2-4(a)(c) in the quadratic formula
2. If the answer was negative I made note of that
3. If it wasnt then a took the square root of that number and noted it
4. If the number was negative then there would be no real solutions
5. Since the quadratic formula can have two possible solutions +- I did two different calculation
    1.One where I subratct the expression
    2.One where I add them
6. If both answers were the same,then there would be only one solution
7. If not then there would be two solutions
##Differences
- the only real difference is the order in which I did things. 
- I did this as If I changed the order of some things I did then that would give me the wring input 
- for example I had to check if the value under the radical was negative first

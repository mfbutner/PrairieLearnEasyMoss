Solution for quadratic equition

*1.decide the a,b,c value  of equation ax**2 + bx +c

*2.solving the equition by bring  values in step 1 into quadratic equation
    x**2 = (-b +- (b**2 -4ac)**0.5)/2
    
    


*1.decide the a,b,c value  of equation ax**2 + bx +c
   
   
   there is a math equation with the format ax**2 + bx +c. a b c can be any real numbur.
   
   eg 5x**2 + 3x +8    a = 5 b = 3 c = 8
   eg -7** -9x -111    a = -7 b = -9 c = -111
   
   you can use whatever value you like in a b c, but they must be real number without decimal points
   and a cannot equals to 0.
   
   x**2 = (-b +- (b**2 -4ac)**0.5)/2a is the Quadratic equation we used latter. a cannot be zero because denominator cannot be zere.
   
   
   
  *2.bring a b c value into the Quadratic equation x**2 = (-b +- (b**2 -4ac)**0.5)/2a
     
     
     Quadratic equation will tell us the possible value of x. There are three posible result for x
     
     ***1 there are two possible different x value
     ***2 there is only one x value
     ***3 thre is two x value but they are not real nunber
     
     
     
***1 we print that two x values on screen with 2 decimal points

***2 we print that one x values on screen with 2 decimal points

***3 we say that there is no solution for such equation becasue we don't accept non-real value for x

# My Algorithm (steps to solve the problem)
## Determine all the solutions/ real roots of the quadratic formula

1. Ask the user for values for letters a, b, and c of the quadratic equation 
2. Determine how many solutions/real roots there are to the quadratic formula
3. Announce the solutions of the quadratic formula and what they are

## Determine the number of solutions of the quadratic formula 
1. Calculate the discriminant 
    1. If the discriminant is positive
        1. The quadratic equation has two solutions
    2. If the discriminant is equal to 0
        1. The quadratic formula has one solution
    3. If the discriminant is negative
        1. The quadratic formula has no solution

## Announce the Solutions of the quadratic formula
1. If there was one solution
    1. Say there was one solution, calculate the value of the one solution, and say what it was
2. If there were two solutions
    1. Say there were two solutions, calculate the value of the two solutions, and say what they were 
3. If there were no solutions
    1. Say there were no solutions

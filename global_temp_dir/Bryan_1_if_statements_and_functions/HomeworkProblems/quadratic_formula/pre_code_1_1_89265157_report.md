# My Algorithm (steps to solve the problem)
# Quadratic Formula 
    1. Explain what a quadratic formula is 
    2. Set up the formula
    3. Solve the formula

## Explain what a quadratic equation is
    1. A polynomial that is in the form of x^2 + x + c(constant)
    2. Must have at least x^2 to be considered a quadratic equation

## Set up the formula 
    1. Write down the formula x = (-b +- the square root of (b^2 - 4*a*c))/2*a
    2. Explain the variables 
## Explain the variables
    1. x^2 will equal a
    2. x by itself will equal b
    3. c(constant) will equal c
## Use the formula
    1. Plus in the numbers that are equal to the variables

## No solution
    1. If what is under the square root is a negative number

## One solution
    1. If what is under the square root is equal to zero
    
## Two solution
    1. If what is under the square root is a positive number
    2. Add one solution where what is under the square root has a plus in front 
    3. Add one solution where what is under the square root has a negative in front
    
## Give Answer
    1. Tell what the solution is if any by plugging in all variables

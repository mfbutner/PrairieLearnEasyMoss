# My Algorithm (steps to solve the problem)
Ask the user for a, b and c
calculate answer
output answer

##calculate answer
check if there are solutions by seeing if the discriminant is greater than 0
put a b and c into the quadratic formula and get the answer
quadratic formula needs to be run twice for the 2 solutions.

##output answer
prints the solution or lack of solutions

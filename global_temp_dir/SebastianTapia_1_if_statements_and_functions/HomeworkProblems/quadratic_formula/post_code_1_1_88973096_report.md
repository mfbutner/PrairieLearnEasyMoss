# How I solved
## Get values to put in the formula
1. The formula has a, b, and c values that need numeric values to complete the formula
2. These can be any numeric values but value "a" should not be 0 because the formula won't work.
3. The formula is negative "b" (+ or -) the square root of "b" squared minus the multiplication of 4, "a", and "c". All of this will be divided by 2 times "a".

## First part in solving quadratic formula
1. First input the a, b, and c numeric values in the square root part of the formula.
2. Get a value from the calculations made but don't sqaure root yet.
3. A value less than zero means there will be no real solutions so there is no need to contiue on with the formula
4. A value equal to zero means there is only one real solution.
5. A value greater than zero means there will be two real solutions.

## Completely solve the formula
1. With one real solution, just divide the negative "b" by 2 times "a" to get the solution.
2. With 2 real solutions, square root the calculation inside the square root part of the formula and then add and subtract them from negative "b". Then divide both values by 2 times "a" to get two solutions.

# Differences
There was no major differences between this explanation and how I explained to solve it in the first place. The one difference is that in my first explanation I went step by step to solve the quadratic formula but in this explanation, I took more emphasis in the inside of the square root first and just doing the rest of the formula in one step.

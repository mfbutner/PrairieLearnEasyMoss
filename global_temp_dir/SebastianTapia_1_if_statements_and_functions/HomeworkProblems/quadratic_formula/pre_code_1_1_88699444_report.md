# Using the quadratic formula to find its roots
##Get values to put in quadratic formula
1. The quadratic equation will have the "a" value in first part of equation, with the b value being in the second part and c value being in the last part (ax^2 + bx + c)
2. Get the numeric values to put in a, b, and c parts of the quadratic formula
3. Make sure "a" doesn't have a value of zero because the quadrtic formula won't work
##Start to form the quadratic formula
1. The quadratic formula is -b (+ or -) the square root of b^2 - 4ac all divided by 2 times a
2. Plug in the b value at the beginning of the formula where it makes it negative and inside the square root where it will be squared
3. Plug in the "a" value inside the square root where it's subtracting from the b squared value and plug in at the denominator part of the formula where it's multiplied by two
4. Plug in the c value in the square root part of the formula where it will  be multiplied with 4 and a value
##Start solving the quadratic formula
1. Solve square root part of equation first, squaring the b value and the subtracting the multiplication of 4, b, and a from it and then square root the result.
2. This part will help show how many root values of x it will have to make quadratic equation evaluate to 0. A value less than zero will evaluate to it having no real roots. A value equal to zero will evaluate to it having one real root. A value greater than zero will evaluate to it having two real roots.
3. There is no need to continue on with the equation if the square root part has no real root values.
4. Continue on solving the equation by both adding and subtracting what you get from the square root value to the negative b value at the beginning of the numerator part of the formula.
##Finish solving the quadratic formula
1. Once you get the final value from the top in the numerator, you will either have one or two values because of the addition and subtraction part.
2. Divide those values by the multiplication of 2 and the value of a
3. This will then get you the root values of x that make the quadratic equation evaluate to zero.

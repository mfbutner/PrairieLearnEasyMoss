# List of steps to solve the problem:
1. Get the input from user
2. Check to see if it is a perfect square
3. Check to see if the determinant is negative 
4. Apply quadratic formula to quadratic
5. Give back the resulting roots 
##Get input 
- Get input from the user on the quadratic they would like to have solved
##Check perfect square
- Check to see if the quadratic is a perfect square
- If it is, then there will be only one root
##Check Determinant
- Check to see if the determinant would be negative
- If it is negative, then we have imaginary root(s)
- If not, then the root(s) will be real
##Apply quadratic
- Apply the quadratic formula onto the inputted quadratic to find the root(s)
##Give back results
- Once answers are obtained, check if they are real or not
- Tell them how many real roots there are and only output those

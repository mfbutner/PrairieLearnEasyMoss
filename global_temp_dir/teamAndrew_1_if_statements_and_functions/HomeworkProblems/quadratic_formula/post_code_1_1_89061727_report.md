# Algorithm (steps to solve the problem)
1. Get input from the user on what their quadratic equation is
2. Check the discriminant and see whether it is positive, negative or zero
3. Depending on the discriminant, output different statements 
##Get input from user
- Ask the user for their a, b, and c values of their quadratic
##Check the discriminant
- Check the discriminant to see if it is positive, zero or negative
- If it is positive, there are 2 real roots, zero is 1 real root, and negative is 0 real roots
##Output
- If there are 2 real roots, output the 2 solutions
- If there is 1 real root, output the one solution
- If 0 real roots, then output that there are no real roots
# Differences
- One difference is that I thought I would need to have 2 different checks for the discriminant, one if it was 0 and one if it was nonzero. I ended up just joining the checks together for simplicity and clarity

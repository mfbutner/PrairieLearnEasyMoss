# Algorithm (steps to solve the problem)

I initialized variables a, b, and c to be referenced later in the program. Knowing that I needed to prompt the user, I wrote some statements so the user knew the format of the answer they should be giving back as an input. Each input was associated to objects: a, b, and c. 

With the variables each given values, it was important to start the operation on the quadratic formula and find solutions. I realized a bit later on that when performing a square root in the quadratic formula, a negative value within that function wouldn't work. I created a conditional statement assuming the value within the square root was negative to be set to "no solution" and computed the values in the case that there was a positive value within the square root. 

I forgot to factor in that sometimes there are 2, 1, or no solutions within a quadratic formula so I made statements for each scenario. 

# Differences

Minor Difference:
1) There should be 2 solutions, 1 solution, and 0 solution scenarios that I didn't explicity state in my instructions.

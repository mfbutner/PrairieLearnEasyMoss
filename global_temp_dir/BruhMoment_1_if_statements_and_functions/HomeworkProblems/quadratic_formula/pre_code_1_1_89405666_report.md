# My Algorithm (steps to solve the problem)

## Include important headers for this operation
1) stdio.h is necessary for any C program
2) math.h is necessary for utilizing math functions like powers

## Initialize and mention variables to be used for this problem (ie. standard form: |ax^2 + bx + c| where a, b, and c are variables)
1) variable a now exists
2) variable b has been given life
3) variable c is here

## Ask user to place the problem in standard form: (ie. "ax^2 + bx + c = 0")
1) Check if the input is in standard form
2) Make sure a valid number is entered for all variables: a, b, and c

## If all the above is valid and a, b, and c are valid... compute x1 and x2
1) Initialize variable x1 variable x2 to be values of the quadratic's answers  

## Place variables a, b, and c in the quadratic formula to solve
1) Structure quadratic where the function adds to result in x1: x1 = ( ((-b) + sqrt(b - 4ac) ) / 2a ) 
2) Structure quadratic variables for second result variable x2: x2 = ( ((-b) + sqrt(b - 4ac) ) / 2a ) 
3) Display results: x1 and x2

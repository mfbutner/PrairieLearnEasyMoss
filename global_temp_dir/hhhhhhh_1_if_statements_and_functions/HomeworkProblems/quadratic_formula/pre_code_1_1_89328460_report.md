# My Algorithm (steps to solve the problem)

## Find the real root of x in the quadratic equation
- Get the a,b,c values
- Write the roots of quadratic equation
- Put the values of a,b,c to the quadratic equation
- Get the solutions of x
- Determine whether the x solutions are real numbers
- Show the results

## Get the a,b,c values
1. Determine the value of a
2. Determine the value of b
3. Determine the value of c

## Write the roots of quadratic equation
1. The numerator of the roots of quadratic equation is -b plus square root of the difference
 of the square of b and 4ac or -b minus square root of the difference
 of the square of b and 4ac
2. The denominator of the roots of quadratic equation is 2a

## Put the values of a,b,c to the quadratic equation
1. Put the value of a that determine above
2. Put the value of b that determine above
3. Put the value of c that determine above

## Get the solutions of x
1. Use the roots of quadratic equation find the values of x

## Determine whether the x solutions are real numbers
1. If the value inside the square root is negative, this is not a real value
2. If the value of denominator is 0, this is not a real value

## Show the results
1. If there are 2 real solution, show the real solutions separately
2. If there is 1 real solution, show the real solution
3. If there is 0 real solution, show there is no real solution

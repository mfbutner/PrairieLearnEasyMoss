# Algorithm (steps to solve the problem)

## Find the real root of x in the quadratic equation
- Get the a,b,c values
- Write the roots of quadratic equation
- Put the values of a,b,c to the quadratic equation
- Get the solutions of x
- Determine whether the x solutions are real numbers and Show the results

## Get the a,b,c values
1. Determine the value of a
2. Determine the value of b
3. Determine the value of c

## Write the roots of quadratic equation
1. The numerator of the roots of quadratic equation is -b plus square root of the difference
 of the square of b and 4ac or -b minus square root of the difference
 of the square of b and 4ac
2. The denominator of the roots of quadratic equation is 2a

## Put the values of a,b,c to the quadratic equation
1. Put the value of a that determine above
2. Put the value of b that determine above
3. Put the value of c that determine above

## Get the solutions of x
1. Use the roots of quadratic equation find the values of x

## Determine whether the x solutions are real numbers and Show the results
1. If the difference of the square of b and 4ac is bigger than 0, there are 2 real solutions
2. If the difference of the square of b and 4ac is 0, there are 1 real solutions
3. If the difference of the square of b and 4ac is smaller than 0, there are 0 real solutions

# Differences
- The way I used to find how many real values for x is different. Bacause the Assumptions is The user will never enter a value of 0 for the "a" variable, I do not need to check the denominator part of the roots of quadratic equation.

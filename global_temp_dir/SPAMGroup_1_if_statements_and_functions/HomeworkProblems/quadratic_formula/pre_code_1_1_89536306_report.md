# My Algorithm (steps to solve the problem)


## Finding Solutions for a quadratic equation
1. obtain numbers to be used for a, b, and c in the quadratic formula
2. use a,b,c to calculate the solutions and how many there are

## Obtain numbers to be used for a, b, and c in the quadratic formula
1. ask the user for numbers corresponding to a, b, and c

## Use a, b, and c to calculate the solutions and how many there are
1. break up the quadratic formula into smaller parts
2. combine the smaller parts back together into the original quadratic formula and evaluate
3. find out how many solutions there are

## Break up the quadratic formula into smaller parts
1. calculate the discriminant using the user's numbers for a, b, and c
2. calculate the denominator of the quadratic formula

## Combine the smaller parts back together into the original quadratic formula and evaluate
1. add negative b to the solved discriminant and divide by the denominator 

## Find out how many solutions there are
1. if the 4AC part of the discriminant is greater than B squared then there are no solutions
2. if both the negative and positive discriminant values are equal to each other, there is one solution
3. if both the positive and negative discriminant values are not equal to each other, there are two solutions

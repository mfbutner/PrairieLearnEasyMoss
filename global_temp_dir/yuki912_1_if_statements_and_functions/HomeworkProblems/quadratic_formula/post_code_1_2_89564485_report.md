##Solve quadratic equations
1. Get a value of coefficients and a constant
2. Solve the equation using the quadratic formula

##Get a value of coefficients and a constant
1. Decide three numbers of a, b, and c 
2. Assign the numbers to a, b, and c in the quadratic equation x = a*x^2 + b*x + c

##The range of a, b and c 
1. All of the numbers should be a real number
**- I did not specify the range of a, b, and c because the inputs were always real numbers in this question.**


##Solve the equation
1. Assign the value of a, b, and c in the quadratic equation to a, b, and c in the quadratic formula correspondingly.
2. Using the discriminant of a quadratic equation, check the number of real solutions.
3. Announce the number of real solutions.
4. Answer the real solutions

##Quadratic formula
1. The following is the quadratic formula: x = (-b+-([?]b*2-4ac)) / 2a

##The discriminant of a quadratic equation
1. The following is the discriminant of the quadratic formula: b*2-4ac

##Check the number of real solutions
1. The equation has two real solutions if b*2-4ac > 0.
**-To modify the order of the answers, I classified into several cases. 
      1)one of the two solutions is positive number. 
      2)both are positive numbers.
      3)both are negative numbers.**
2. The equation has one real solution if b*2-4ac = 0.
3. The equation has no real solution if b*2-4ac < 0. 

##Answer the real solutions
1. Solve the expression, using the quadratic formula.
2. If the number of the real solutions is 2, show the two real solutions.
3. If the number of the real solution is 1, show the one real solution.
4. If the number of the real solution is 0, show no real solution.

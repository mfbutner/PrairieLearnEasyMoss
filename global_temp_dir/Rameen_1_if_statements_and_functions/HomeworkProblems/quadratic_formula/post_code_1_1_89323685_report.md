# Algorithm (steps to solve the problem)

## Identify values of variables
    1. Identify the coefficiant of x^2
        *This value belongs to the a variable
    2. Identify the coefficiant of x
        *This value belongs to the b variable
    3. Identify the constant
        *This value belongs to the c variable
    4. Using a, b, and c, calculate (b^2 - 4ac)
        *This value belongs to the d variable

## Use variables in quadratic formula 
    1. D is a negative value
        *There is no solution for x1 nor x2
    2. D is a zero value
        *Insert a and b into (-b / 2a) to solve for x1
    3. D is a positive value
        *Insert a, b, c, and d into (-b + d^(1/2)) / (2a) to solve for x1
        *Insert a, b, c, and d into (-b - d^(1/2)) / (2a) to solve for x2
    4. x1 and x2 (if applicable) are the solved values for x using the quadratic formula

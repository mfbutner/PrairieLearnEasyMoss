# Algorithm (steps to solve the problem)
## Step 1: Assign values
    - give values to a, b, and c in the equation ax^2 + bx + c individually
## Step 2: Plug into the quadratic formula
    - 1: square the b 
    - 2: multiply 4*a*c
    - 3: solve the value of #1 and subtract the value of #2
    - 4: square root it(when there is a imaginary solution refer to heading step 5; refer to step 6 when the answer is 0)
    - 5: From this step, you will need to do two separate calculations:
        - 5a: take value of -b and add the value of #3
        - 5b: take value of -b and subtract the value of #3
    - 6: divide both answers by 2*a
## Step 3: Counting your answers
    - Take all the real answers that you get and state the number of answers you have
## Step 4: Writing your answers
    - take your value from 5a, this will be your first solution
    - take your value from 5b, this will be your second solution
## Step 5: Imaginary solutions
    - because your answer is imaginary, you have no real solutions. 
    - make sure you say that it has no solutions
## Step 6: Your determinant is zero
    - therefore, you only have one real answer.

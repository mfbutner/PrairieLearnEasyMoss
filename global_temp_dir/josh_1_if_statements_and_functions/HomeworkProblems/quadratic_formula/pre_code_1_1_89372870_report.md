# My Algorithm (steps to solve the problem)

#SOLVE QUADRATIC EQUATION
##1. Get values of equation (ax^2+bx+c formatted equation).
##2. Check for how many real solutions there are (use discriminant).
##3. Solve the quadratic equation for the real solutions. 

##1. Get values of equations.
###a) Ask for the value of a.
###b) Ask for the value of b.
###c) Ask for the value of c.

##2. Check for how many real solutions there are (using the discriminant b^2-4ac).
###a) If the discriminant value is greater than 0, then there are 2 real solutions.
###b) If the discriminant value is equal to 0, then there are 1 real solution.
###c) If the discriminant value is less than 0, then there are no real solutions. 

##3. Solve the quadratic equation for the real solutions.
###a) Plug values into the equation.
###b) Give the user the real solution(s) to the equation.

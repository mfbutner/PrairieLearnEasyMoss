# Algorithm (steps to solve the problem)
#Solve Quadratic Equation
##1. Get values of the equation (a, b, c).
##2. Find number of real solution(s) and output the solution(s).

##1. Get values of the equation.
###a) Ask user for a.
###b) Ask user for b.
###c) Ask user for c.

##2. Find number of real solution(s) and output the solution(s).
###a) If discriminant is greater than 0, then there are 2 solutions.
#### Use both quadratic equations and output the solutions.
###b) If discriminant is equal to 0, then there are one solution.
#### Use quadratic equation and output the solution.
###c) If discriminant is less than 0, then there are no real solutions.


# Differences
1. Combined the part where the number of solutions is determined and the solutions themselves are determined. This is due to the fact that the discriminant is also used in finding the solution, so they are closely related.

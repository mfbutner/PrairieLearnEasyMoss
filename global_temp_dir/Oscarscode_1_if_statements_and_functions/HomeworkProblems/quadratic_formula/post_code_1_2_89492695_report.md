# Algorithm (steps to solve the problem)

##Run Quadratic Formula
1. Get inputs
2. Find roots
3. Display roots 

##Get inputs
1. ask for a,b,c values
2. check each input is valid 
3. If input is valid assign value to each variable

##Determibe How many Roots Each function has
1. Plug in values to the discriminant
2. assign the number of roots based on the discriminant value 

##Find roots
1. Check if the function has roots 
2.plug in each corresponding value into the quadratic forumla
3. get the roots if any

##Display roots
1. Display roots if there are roots. 
2. Say there are no roots if not any.

# Differences
I added a step to determine the number of roots each function has since the discriminant lets you know if it'tt have two, one, or zero rootss. I also added that step as pre-req for  the find roots step

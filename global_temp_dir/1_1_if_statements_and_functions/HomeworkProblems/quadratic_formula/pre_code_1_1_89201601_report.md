## Using Quadratic Formula to Solve Equation
1. Get input from the user (A, B, C)
2. Determine discriminant (discriminant = b^2 - 4*a*c)
    - If the discriminant is less than 0 there are no solutions
    - If the discriminant is greater than 0 there are two real solutions
    - If the discriminant is 0 there is one real solution
3. Using the quadratic formula and discriminant, solve for the solutions

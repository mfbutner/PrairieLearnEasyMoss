##Solving the Quadratic Equation
1. Ask for coefficient values of a, b, and c.
2. Solve for the discriminant.
3. Determine the number of real solutions from discriminant value and solve for x values.
##Receive coefficent values
1. Write the equation that solves for the discriminant.
2. Receive coefficent values that correspond to the values of a, b, and c.
##Solve for the discriminant
1. Calculate the discriminant with the given values using the formula.
##Determine number of real solutions
1. Determine the number of solutions based on if discriminant value is positive, negative, or zero.
##Two Solutions 
1. If the discriminant value is positive, there are two real solutions.
2. Using the quadratic formula, solve for the two x value.
##One solution
1. If the discriminant value is equal to zero, there is one real solution.
2. Using the quadratic formula, solve for the one x value.
##No solution
1. If the discriminant value is negative, there are no real solutions.
##Changes
..* Changed "Set up the equation" to "Ask for coefficient values of a, b, and c." My program first asks for user inputs of the coefficients, which is necessary before even being able to set up the equation with its variables. This step is also more specific.

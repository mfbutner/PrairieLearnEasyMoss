# Algorithm (steps to solve the problem)
Solving the Problem
    1.Finding which numbers represent a, b, and c
    2.Find out what the quadratic formula is 
    
No Solution
    1.Solve for the number in the square root 
    2.If the number is less than 0, there is no solution 
    
One Solution 
    1.If the number in the root is 0, there is only one solution 
    2.You find this solution by doing -b / 2a
    
Two Solutions 
    1.If the number in the root is positive, then there are 2 solutions
    2.One solution is found by adding the sqaure root of that number 
    3.The other solution is found by subtracting the square root of that number 
    
Ordering the Two Solutions
    1.If there are two negative solutions, the greater value is listed first 
    2.If there are two positive solutions, the lesser value is listed first

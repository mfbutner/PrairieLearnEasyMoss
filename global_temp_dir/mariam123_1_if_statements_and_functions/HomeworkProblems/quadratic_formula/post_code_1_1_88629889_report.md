# Algorithm (steps to solve the problem)
## Get Input
    1. asked the user to input values of a,b and c, and stored them.
    
## Calculate Discriminant using formula b^2 - 4ac
    1. if the result of b^2 - 4ac is greater than 0, then the expression has two roots
            i) calculated the two roots using the quadratic formula
    2. if the result of b^2 - 4ac is equal to 0, then the expression has one root
            i) calculated the root using quadratic formula
    3. if the result of b^2 - 4ac is less than 0, then the expression has no roots

# Differences
    1. There was one minor difference in my original and current solution. In the original solution, I had planned on calculating the value and number of roots separately. However, in my current solution, I found it easier to just use the formula and calculate the value of roots at the same place as when I was determining how many roots existed.

# My Algorithm (steps to solve the problem)
## Get Input
    1. ask the user to input values of a,b and c, and store them.
    
## Calculate Discriminant using formula b^2 - 4ac
    1. if the result of b^2 - 4ac is greater than 0, then the expression has two roots.
    2. if the result of b^2 - 4ac is equal to 0, then the expression has one root.
    3. if the result of b^2 - 4ac is less than 0, then the expression has no roots
    
## Calculate the Roots
    1. calculate roots using the quadratic formula, only for the expressions with existing roots, as determined by the previous step.

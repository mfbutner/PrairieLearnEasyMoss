# Algorithm (steps to solve the problem)

## Ask user for values
- Ask user for value a
- Ask user for value b
- Ask user for value c

## Determine number of solutions
- No real solution
    - if discriminant is negative
- One real solution
    - if discriminant is positive and the + and - roots are the same
- Two real solutions
    - if discriminant is positive and the + and - roots are different
        
## Calculate roots using quadratic equation
- Calculate the plus solution
- Calculate the minus solution
    
## Display number of roots (if there are any)
- If no real solution exists, indicate there are no real solutions
- Otherwise, display the real solution(s) rounded to two decimal places

# Differences
- Specifying how to determine whether there is one or two solutions when at least one solution exists
    - Needed to compare the plus solution to the minus solution

# My Algorithm (steps to solve the problem)

## Ask user for values
- Ask user for value a
- Ask user for value b
- Ask user for value c

## Calculate roots using quadratic equation
- First determine if at least one solution exists. 
    - Check that the discriminant is not negative: 
        - If value is not negative: solve for root(s) using quadratic equation
            - Account for both + and - operations in +-. 
        - If value IS negative: display no real solution exists

## Determine number of solutions
- Three possible paths:
    - No real solution
    - One real solution
    - Two real solutions
    
## Display number of roots (if there are any)
- If no real solution exists, indicate there are no real solutions
- Otherwise, display the real solution(s) rounded to two decimal places

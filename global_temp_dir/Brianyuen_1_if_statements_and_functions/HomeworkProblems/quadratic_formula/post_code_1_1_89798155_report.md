# Algorithm (steps to solve the problem)

## Solve Equation Using The Quadratic Formula
	1. Set up Quadratic Formula
    2. Determine number of solutions
    3. Compute First Solution
    4. Compute second solution
    
## Determine number of solutions (1)
	1. Equation has one solution
    	a. When the second coefficent squared equals four times the first coefficent                times the third coefficient. Thus perform only main step 2 and 3 next.
    2. Equation has two solutions
        a. When the second coefficent squared is greater than four times the first                  coefficent times the third coefficient. Thus perform steps 2,3, and 4 next.
    3. Equation has no solutions
    	a. When the second coefficent squared is less than four times the first                      coefficent times the third coefficient. Thus equation has no solutions.
        

## Set Up Quadratic Formula (2)
	1. Numerator Set Up
    	a. Let the second coefficient be multiplied by -1 and plus
           the square root of the square of the second coefficent subtracted by four                times the first coefficent times the third integer value
    2. Denominator Set Up
    	a. Let the first coefficient be multiplied by 2

## Compute First Solution (3)
	1. Take the value computed in the numerator and divide it by the value computed in 
       the denominator. This is your first solution.
       
## Compute Second Solution (4)
	1. Value of denominator is the same
    2. For numerator let the second coefficient be multiplied by -1 and subtracted by
       the square root of the square of the second coefficent subtracted by four times
       the first coefficent times the third integer value. This is your second solution

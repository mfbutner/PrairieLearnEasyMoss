# My Algorithm (steps to solve the problem)

##hat is the Quadratic Formula?
1. The Quadratic Formula allows us to solve a quadratic equation using the form: ax^2+bx+c=0
2. a, b, and c are coefficients
3. Following that form, when ax^2+bx+c=0, then x = -b+/- sqrt(b^2-4*a*c) / (2*a)

###Assigning Your Variables
1. Declare your variables: a, b, and c
2. Give your variables a certain value, for they are coefficients

####Using the Equation
1. When you have a set variables for your coefficients, plug them in to x = -b+/- sqrt(b^2-4*a*c) / (2*a)

#####Results of Using the Equation
1. When the values are plugged in, you are able to solve and get solution resulting in 2 roots
2. The 2 roots are provided when you do both addition AND subtraction

###### When Roots Are Unequal to Each Other
1. You will be provided with 2 roots

####### When Roots are Equal to Each Other
1. You will be provided with 1 root

######## Imaginary Numbers
1. If a root encounters an imaginary number, no solution

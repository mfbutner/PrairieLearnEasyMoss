## The Quadratic Equation
1. You are given x = -b+/- sqrt(b^2-4*a*c) / (2*a), for when ax^2+bx+c=0

## Declaring Variables
1. Variables a, b, c are your coefficients
2. Assign a certain value to your variables
3. The variable determinant results in the root values
    * The determinant is set with formula: b*b-4*a*c
    
## Values from the Determinant
1. The coefficients the user provides for variables a, b, and c will be plugged into the determinant formula

## Setting Certain Conditions
##### Where the Determinant is Greater than 0
1. The user will be provided with 2 root solutions
##### Where the Determinant is Equal to 0
2. The user will be provided with 1 root solution
##### Where the Determinant is Less than 0
3. The result will be no solutions

## Differences
* There were no differences between my original and current solutions

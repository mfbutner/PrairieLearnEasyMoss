# Algorithm (steps to solve the problem)
## b^2-4ac
1. figure out the value for b^2-4ac

## which solution
1. if b^2-4ac equals to 0, then there is one solution
2. if b^2-4ac is less than 0, it is negative and there are no solutions
3. otherwise it means b^2-4ac is postive and not zero so there are two solutions

## solving for the solutions
1. if no solution then there is no solution no calcution is required you are done :>
2. if there is one solution then -b/2*a, because b^2-4ac equals to zero so it doesn't matter. -b/2*a will give the answer. 
3. If there are two solutions then (-b +(b^2-4ac)^(1/2) /2*a and also (-b -(b^2-4ac)^(1/2) /2*a will give the two solutions 

## Examples I did
1. 1x^2 + 2x + c -> (-2 +- (4-4)^1/2)/2 --> this made me realized that for all one solutions it's because the b^2-4ac is zero and there is no need to add and minus so only one solution. 
2. 4x^2 + 3x + 7 -> (-3 +- (9-144)^(1/2))/14 --> this made me realize that when b^2-4ac is less than zero then there is no solution cause it gives an error to square root it. 

# Differences
The logic I thought of was the same. I did the examples before doing the programming just forgot to add them there.

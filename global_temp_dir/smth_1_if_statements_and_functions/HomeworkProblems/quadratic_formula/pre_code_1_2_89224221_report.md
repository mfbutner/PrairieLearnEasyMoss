# My Algorithm (steps to solve the problem)
##Solve the quadratic equation problem
1. find out the of equation we are going to solve
2. determine whether there is a real solution for the equation and get the equation solution 

##Find out equation
1. ask what the value of a, b, and c is corresponding to ax^2 + bx + c from the user

##Equation solution
1. check what the value of b^2-4ac is.
    a. the value greater than 0, then there are two real solutions
    b. the value equal to 0, then there is one real solutions
    c. the value less than 0, there is no real solution
2. if there is real soltion exit, use the formula to solve for the result.

##Show the result
1. show what the result is going to be depending on what the how many solution are there.

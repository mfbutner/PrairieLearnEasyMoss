# Algorithm (steps to solve the problem)
##Solve the quatratic equation
1. recieve the problem we are trying to solve from the user\
2. solve the problem depending on different equation

##Recieve the equation
1. ask user what the equation is 
2. pick out the value of a, b and c from equation ax^2 + bx +c

##solve the equation 
1. check how many solutions are there for the equation we got
a. if there are two solution, use the formula to solve the problem
b. if there is one solution, calculate -b/2a to solve the problem
c. other than that, there is no solution, show it to user
2. show the user the final result after calculation
# Differences
There is not that much difference than what I planed before.

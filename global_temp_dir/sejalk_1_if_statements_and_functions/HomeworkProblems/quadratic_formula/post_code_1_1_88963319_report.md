# Algorithm (steps to solve the problem)
#### 1. Get a, b, c values from user
#### 2. Find number of real solutions 
#### 3. Find the solutions

# Get a, b, c values from user
#### 1. prompt user to give a, b, and c values
#### 2. store each of the values in a variable

# Find number of real  solutions
#### 1. assign a variable to equal b^2 - 4ac 
#### 2. if the variable is greater than 0
###### a. there are 2 solutions
#### 3. if the variable is equal 0
###### a. there is 1 solution
#### 4. else
###### a. there are 0 solutions

# Find the solutions
#### 1. if number of solutions is 0
###### a. print that there are no solutions
#### 2. if number of solutions is 1
###### a. create a variable for the solution
###### b. assign the solution given by -b/2a to the variable
###### c. print the solution
#### 3. if number of solutions is 2
###### a. create 2 variables for each of the solutions
###### b. solve for each of the solutions by using the equation, one with adding and another with subtraction and assign the values to each of the variables
###### c. print the 2 solutions

# Differences
Finding the number of solutions and the solutions were apart of the finding the solutions step but added both of them to the original algorithm. When finding the number of solutions I changed the order from what I intially had planned. The rest of the code is the same as my original plan.

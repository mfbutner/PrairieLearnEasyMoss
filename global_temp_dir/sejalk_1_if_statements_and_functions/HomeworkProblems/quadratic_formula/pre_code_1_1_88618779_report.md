# My Algorithm (steps to solve the problem)
#### 1. Get a, b, c values from user
#### 2. Find real solutions

# Get a, b, c values from user
#### 1. prompt user to give a, b, and c values
#### 2. store each of the values in a variable

# Find real solutions
#### 1. Find number of solutions
#### 2. Find the solutions


# Find number of solutions
#### 1. assign a variable to equal b^2 - 4ac 
#### 2. if the variable is less than 0
###### a. there are 0 solutions
#### 3. if the variable is equal 0
###### a. there are 1 solution
#### 4. if the variable is greater than 0
###### a. there are 2 solutions


# Find the solutions
#### 1. if number of solutions is 0
###### a. print that there are no solutions
#### 2. if number of solutions is 1
###### a. create a variable for the solution
###### b. assign the solution given by -b/2a to the variable
###### c. print the solution
#### 3. if number of solutions is 2
###### a. create 2 variables for each of the solutions
###### b. solve for each of the solutions by using the equation, one with adding and another with subtraction and assign the values to each of the variables
###### c. print the 2 solutions

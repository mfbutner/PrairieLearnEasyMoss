# Algorithm (steps to solve the problem)
1. get values from the user
2. calculate the roots using quadratic formula

## Get values from the user
1. get inputs for a b c to use in quadratic formula

## Calculate the roots using quadratic formula
1. calculate the values of the square root part of the formula
2. make sure the value is not negative, otherwise let the user know there are no solutions
3. calculate two solutions by dividng by adding and subtracting by -b and dividing by 2a
4. if the solutions are the same, let the user know of the value and that there is only one solution
5. if the solutions are different, print both solutions

# Differences
1. make sure the value of the square root not negative
2. calculate the two solutions separately
3. make sure that if the solutions are the same, let the user know that there is only one solutions

# My Algorithm (steps to solve the problem)
## Calculate the numerator
### Inside the square 
#### -do b squared
#### -multiply a by c and the product of that by 4
#### -subtract b squared by 4ac
### Outside the Square root
#### **MUST calculate the inside of the square root FIRST to do this**
#### -take the square root of b squared minus 4ac
#### -add negative b to the square root of b squared minus 4ac (this is the numerator of the first fraction)
#### -subtract negative b by the square root of b squared minus 4ac (this is the numerator of the second fraction)
## Calculate the denominator
### -multiply a by 2 (this will be the denominator for both fractions)
## Putting it together
### -the solution will be in {fractionA,fractionB}
#### - fractionA is the numerator of the first fraction(the one where negative b was added) divided by the calculated denominator
#### - fractionB is the numerator of the first fraction(the one where negative b was subtracted) divided by the calculated denominator

# Algorithm (steps to solve the problem)
##To solve this problem, I started by calculating the discriminant.
### To do this, I did b squared minus 4 multiplied by a and then multiplied by c
### I also calculated the denominator by multiplying a by 2
## After solving the discriminant and the denominator, I calculated the solution
### I did this by adding negative b to the square root of the discriminant and then dividing by the denominator for one solution
### For the other solution, I subtracted negative b by the square root of the discriminant and then divided by the denominator.
#### However, to be certain these were real number solutions, I had to check if the discriminant was a nonnegative number.
##### If the discriminant was positive, both solutions were real numbers.
##### If the discriminant was zero, the solutions were equal to each other, giving only one solution, which was real.
##### If the discriminant was negative, then taking the square root of that number would lead to imaginary numbers, causing there to be no real number solution.

# Differences
## To solve this problem, I completely changed my plan from my proposed solution. I did way less steps, for example instead of calculating wach part individually and then putting it all together, I did most of it in one step. I made this change to make the overall process less complex. Additionally in my proposed solution, I forgot to check if the discriminant was a nonnegative number in order to see if the solution would be real numbers. However, I remembered to do this and had to make this change to ensure I was only providing real number solutions.

# Algorithm (steps to solve the problem)

## solve quadratic equation
  1. get the quadratic equation that needs to be solved
  2. gives the solution to the quadratic equation

## get the quadratic equation that needs to be solved
  1. According to the format of the quadratic equation, determine the coefficient of each term

## According to the format of the quadratic equation, determine the coefficient of each term
   1. The format of the quadratic equation is ax^2+bx+c, so we need to get the values of a, b, c

## gives the solution to the quadratic equation
  1. Give the number of solutions and the specific solution

## get the values of a, b, c
  1. ask the user the value of a,b,c

## Give the number of solutions and the specific solution
  1. Depending on the values of a, b, and c there may be 0, 1, or 2 real solutions.
  2. if there are more than 0 real solutions, give the the specific solution.

## give the the specific solution.
  1. using the quadratic equation to calculate the solution.

# Differences
1. Moved the "Give the number of solutions and the specific solution" step after the "get the values of a, b, c" step to make the algorithm more consistent with the order allowed by the program.

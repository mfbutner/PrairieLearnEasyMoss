## solve quadratic equation
  1. get the quadratic equation that needs to be solved
  2. gives the solution to the quadratic equation

## get the quadratic equation that needs to be solved
  1. According to the format of the quadratic equation, determine the coefficient of each term

## gives the solution to the quadratic equation
  1. Give the number of solutions and the specific solution

## According to the format of the quadratic equation, determine the coefficient of each term
   1. The format of the quadratic equation is ax^2+bx+c, so we need to get the values of a, b, c

## get the values of a, b, c
  1. ask the user the value of a,b,c

## Give the number of solutions and the specific solution
  1. Depending on the values of a, b, and c there may be 0, 1, or 2 real solutions.
  2. if there are more than 0 real solutions, give the the specific solution.

## give the the specific solution.
  1. using the quadratic equation to calculate the solution.

# My Algorithm (steps to solve the problem)
##Get inputs from the user
1. Request a value for a and write it down
2. Request a value for b and write it down
3. Request a value for c and write it down
##Calculate the discriminant
1. Calculate the discriminant using the formula b^2 - 4ac and write it down
2. If the discriminant is negative, there will be no real solutions, so simply tell the user there are no solutions and end the process without doing any further steps
3. Otherwise, proceed

##Calculate the solution(s)
1. Calculate the first possibility using the formula (-b + sqrt(the discriminant)) / 2a
2. Calculate the second possibility using the formula (-b - sqrt(the discriminant)) / 2a
##Give the solutions
1. If both solutions are the same, just give that one solution.
2. If there's two solutions, give them both.

# Algorithm (steps to solve the problem)
1. Promted the user to input 3 different values based on the form, a*x^2 + b * x + c
    -  (Seperated by a, b, and c)
    - (Speretartely asked the user to input a number for a, b, and c)

#### 2. The program would find the roots of the quadratic formula
    - The 3 numbers the user inputed are used to find the discriminate of the formula

    - If the discriminate was 0, then the program would use one equation to outpute ONE root
    
    - If the discriminate was more than 0, the program would use two equations to output TWO seperate roots
    
    - If the discriminate was less than 0, then the program would ouput that no realsolutions exist



# Differences
- Promted the user to input a number for a, b, and c seperately instead of at the same time
    - (Made it easier for me to seperate the values and see which one was for a, b, or c)

- Switched the order to see discriminate value to solve the roots
    - (I don't have a particular reason on this decision, it just looked better to me)

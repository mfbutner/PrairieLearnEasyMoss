# My Algorithm (steps to solve the problem)

1. Ask user to input values a, b, and c based on the quadratic equation

2. I will use the numbers to find the discriminate

3. Using the discriminate value, I will find the roots of the quadratic formula
    - If there aren't any roots, I will say there are no real solutions
    - If there is only one real solution, the value will be shown
    - If there are two real solutions, the two values will be shown

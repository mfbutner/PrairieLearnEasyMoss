# My Algorithm (steps to solve the problem)
## Find out what values a, b, and c are.
1. You will use the standard quadratic equation ax^2 + bx + c to determine this.
- "a" will be the number in front of x^2, "b" will be the number in front of the x, and "c" will be the final number

##How many real solutions will there be?
- [-b (+/-) sqrt(b^2 - 4ac)] / 2a is the quadratic formula
1. There are no real solutions when, in the quadratic formula, the root b^2 - 4ac is negative.
2. There is one real solution when, in the quadratic formula, the root  b^2 - 4ac is 0.
3. There are two real solutions when, in the quadratic formula, the root  b^2 - 4ac is not negative and not 0.

##Using the quadratic formula to find the roots if there are solution(s).
1. We will substitute the values according to the quadratic formula: [-b + sqrt(b^2 - 4ac)] / 2a
2. If there is only one solutions skip this steps-Do the same except this time it's [-b -sqrt(b^2 - 4ac)] / 2a
- this will yield the solution(s), if any.
3.Display how many solutions there are to the user and if there are solutions display the solution(s)

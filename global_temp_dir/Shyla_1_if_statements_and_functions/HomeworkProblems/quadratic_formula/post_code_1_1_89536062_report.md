# Algorithm (steps to solve the problem)
#Calculate the roots of a quadratic equation of the form a*x^2 + b * x + c
1. Ask the user for a, b, c
2. Calculate the discriminant
3. Determine the number of roots
4. Display the roots of the equation

##Calculating the Discriminant
1. Calculate the Discriminant using the values of a, b, c and the equation discriminant= b^2 - 4ac

##Determine the number of the roots
1. If discriminant is greater than 0, there are two real roots
2. If discriminant is equal to 0, there is one real root
3. If discriminant is less than 0, there are no real roots

##Display the roots of the equation
1. If there are two real roots, calculate them using the formula (-b+ (square root of b^2-4ac)) divided by 2a AND (-b - (square root of b^2-4ac)) divided by 2a
2. If there is one real root, calculate it using the formula (-b+ (square root of b^2-4ac)) divided by 2a OR (-b - (square root of b^2-4ac)) divided by 2a
3. If there are no real roots, solution cannot be calculated

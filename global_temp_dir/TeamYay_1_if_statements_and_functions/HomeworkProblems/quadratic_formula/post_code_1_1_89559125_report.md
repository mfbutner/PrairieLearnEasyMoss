# Algorithm (steps to solve the problem)
## Find the real roots for a quadratic equation
1. Set up the quadratic equation
2. Solve the equation
## Ask user for inputs a, b, and c
## Set up the quadratic equation
1. Figure out the format for the quadratic equation
         x = (-b^2 - (4ac)) / 2a
         x = (-b^2 + (4ac)) / 2a
2. Plug in inputs for a, b, and c
##Solve the quadratic equation
1. Solve for x with the inputs chosen for the variables
    - Follow PEMDAS rules in solving for x
        Solve what is in the parentheses first, then exponents, then multiplication, then division
            Make sure the numerator and denominator are as simiplified as possible before dividing
    - Easier to break up the equation into parts, and then solve. First solve the exponents, then the square root. Then multiply the numerator factors and the demoninator factors separately. Then divide by the numerator and the denominator
    - Two equations to plug into, one with a subtraction sign before the square root, one with an addition sign before the square root. Those possible equations will give you possible answers
##Answers for the equation
- Check if the answers outputted from the equations were real numbers; check will give you one of three options
    1. There could be 0, 1, or 2 answers for the equation
    2. If there are 0 zero answers to the equation,
        - The equation will be unsolvable, and gives you complex solutions. Both equations gave you no real numbers
    3. If there is only 1 answer to the equation,
        - One of the equations was solvable and gave you one real solution.
    4. If there is 2 answers to the equation,
        - Both equations were solvable and gave you two real solutions.
# Differences
- I needed to break down the equations more to understand where my math was going wrong
- Check if the answers were real numbers

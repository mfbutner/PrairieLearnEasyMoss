# My Algorithm (steps to solve the problem)
## Find the real roots for a quadratic equation
    1. Set up the quadratic equation
    2. Solve the equation
## Set up the quadratic equation
    1. Figure out the format for the quadratic equation
         x = (-b^2 - (4ac)) / 2a
         x = (-b^2 + (4ac)) / 2a
    2. Pick inputs for a, b, and c
    3. Plug in inputs for each value
##Solve the quadratic equation
    1. Solve for x with the inputs chosen for the variables
        - Follow PEMDAS rules in solving for x
            Solve what is in the parentheses first,then exponents, then multiplication, then division.
            Make sure the numerator and denominator are as simiplified as possible before dividing
##Answers for the equation
    1. There could be 0, 1, or 2 answers for the equation
    2. If there are 0 zero answers to the equation,
        - The equation will be unsolvable, and gives you complex solutions. 
    3. If there is only 1 answer to the equation,
        - The equation was solvable and gave you one real solution.
    4. If there is 2 answers to the equation,
        - The equation was solvable and gave you two real solutions.

//This program is tasked to solving the quadratic formula (-b Â± sqrt((b*b) - 4*a*c)) / (2*a). In order to solve this, we take a, b, and c as an input and insert them into the quadratic formula, returning the output.

//This first function finds the first answer of the quadratic formula, with -b + sqrt...
//The first fuction takes in 3 double values, which were the a, b, and c values that we took in as inputs in the main function. It has a parameter 'answerOne', which is a double value that returns the value from the quadratic formula with -b + sqrt...

//This second function finds the second answer of the quadratic formula, with -b - sqrt...
//The second fuction takes in 3 double values, which were the a, b, and c values that we took in as inputs in the main function. It has a parameter 'answerTwo', which is a double value that returns the value from the quadratic formula with -b - sqrt...

It then calls upon the quadraticFormulaOne and quadraticFormulaTwo functions, in order to get the two possible answers, which are stored in double parameters answer1 and answer2. If answer1 = answer2 then one real solution is printed. If there is no possible answer than that is stated as well.

#Solve the Quadratic Formula
1. Acquire the required values 
2. Plug the values into the Quadratic formula
3. Solve the quadratic formula for x
## Acquire the required values
1. Obtain the value a (in the formula ax^2 + bx + c)
2. Obtain the value b
3. Obtain the value c
##Plug the values into the Quadratic formula
1. Plug our given a, b, and c values into the formula (-b + (b ** 2 - 4 * a * c) ** 0.5) / (2 * a) for the first value of x.
2. Plug our given a, b, and c values into the formula (-b - (b ** 2 - 4 * a * c) ** 0.5) / (2 * a) for the second value of x
3. Solve and display the first value of x.
4. Solve and display the second value of x.

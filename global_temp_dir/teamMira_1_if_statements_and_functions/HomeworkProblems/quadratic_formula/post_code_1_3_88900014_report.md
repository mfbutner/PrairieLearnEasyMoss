# Algorithm (steps to solve the problem)

# Differences
## I used the void function to add another function beside main.
using void as a function retun type with two parameters that will print the values of case 1
The parameters are root1 and root2, and made them floating numbers.
I used if function to determine which case the value of roots fall under.
The first case if discriminant is postive -- it will print that there are two solutions -- then it will print out the statament in the void function that provide the value for root1 and root2.
Then I used else if function for the case of discriminant is 0 -- it will print that there in one solution and provide its value.
Lastly I used else for the case that the discriminant is negative -- it will print there are no solutions.

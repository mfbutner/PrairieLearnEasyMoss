# Algorithm (steps to solve the problem)
## Get the quadratic equation
    1. Given that a quadratic equation is in the form of ax^2 + bx + c, get the values for a, b, c
        (The values a, b, and c can be integers or decimals)

## Use the quadratic formula to find solutions or roots for the equation
    1. See if the solution is possible
        a. Calculate the value of b squared subtracted by 4 multiplied by a and multiplied by c
        b. According to the formula, the value previously calculated is under a square root, so if the value is 0 or positive, there are solutions
        c. If the value under the square root is negative, there are no real solutions
    2. No real solutions
        a. Announce that there are no real solutions
    3. There are solutions
        a. Find the first solution
            i. In the numerator, negate b then add the square root value 
            i. Then divide that total in the numerator by the value of a multiplied by 2
        b. Find the second solution
            i. In the numerator, negate b then subtract the square root value
            ii. Then divide the total in the numerator by the value of a multiplied by 2
        c. Compare the solutions to see if they are the same or equal
        d. Announce the solutions

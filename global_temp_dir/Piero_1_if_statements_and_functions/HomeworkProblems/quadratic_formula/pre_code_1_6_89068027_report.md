##Solving a Quadratic Formula

---
###Important Information:
Before thinking an answer; first we need to know what a quadratic equation is made of. A quadractic equation is build in the form of ax2 + bx + c, each one of these term's coefficients are necesary in order to solve the equation(The coefficients can be negative numbers or fraction in some cases). The result of this equation will always be 0.
#####Rules to follow:
            .The coefficients must be numbers, of course.
            .The structure has to be the same as shown above.
            .The coefficients could be any Rational Number.
            .If no coefficients are provided, its common sense 
              to consider them to be equal to one, eg: x2 + x + 1 --> 1x2 + 1x + 1.
            .The first part of the equation 'ax2' can be also express as a*x*x, because x*x = x2
            .Following the order when operating is very important, to avoid mistakes 
             one must know the order of operators to solve normal math problems:
                1.Parenthesis ()
                2.Multiplication and Division * and /
                3.Adding and Substraction + -
            .The square root can also be express as x^1/2, which is the contrary of x*x or x2.

###1.-Find the Discriminant:

To solve the equation we need to find the value(s); however, we need to determine if the equation has solutions, and to do that we need to use a mathematical formula: b2 - 4ac.

1.  If the result is more than 0, then the number of results will be two. 
2.  If the result is less than 0, then the number of results will be none.
             In conclusion, which number multiplied by itself gives x, eg: 4 = 2 * 2, root of for is 2, bc 2 * 2 is 4.
3.  If the result is equal 0, then the number of results will be one.

###2.-Solving Possibilities:
Once we find the discriminant you can determine if the quadratic equation can be solve. Starting from that point, we can expect the number of answers we can get and continue with the solving process.

####General Formula:
Using the general formula we can find the solutions, but is important to operate step by step:  

    1.First, we will use the value from the discriminant, mentioned before.
    
    2.Once you find the discriminant value, we will need to  find the number which multiplied by it self gives us the discriminant.
    
    3.Afterwards, we will separate the equation in two, one with the positive value of the discriminant, and the other one with the negative value.
    
    4.So far it should look like this: -b + result / 2a ^ his: -b - result / 2a.
    
    5. All that is left is to simplify or resolve the fraction.
    
    
###3.-Result(s):
Based on the discriminant the number of values vary, which means you can avoid some steps if you already know the outcome; for example, if the discriminant is less than 0, you wont get any solution, at least not without imaginary numbers.
Also and extra step to confirm the results is to replace x with the solutions to check if your results are accurate and precise.

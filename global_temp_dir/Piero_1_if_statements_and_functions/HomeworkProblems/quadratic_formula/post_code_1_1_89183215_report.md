# Algorithm (steps to solve the problem)
(Honestly, is just math. I didnt really had to explain how to actually solve the problem. However, I migh have missunderstood the 3.1 assingment)

#####1.Get numbers
.Get all three numbers to find the discriminant, 
#####2.Find Discriminant
.The discriminant can be found with the numbers using a mathematical formula: b2 - 4ac(common sense even if you dont know how to program)
#####3.Determine Number of Solutions
.Depending if the discriminant is more, less or equal to 0 the number of solutions vary, which is an important step.
#####4.General Formula
.We can take advantage of teh discrinant formula and use it with the general formula to come up with both soulution, with the positive and negative part.
#####5.Announce Results
.All that is left is to see the results and do the equation by hand to prove the answer right.
# Differences

I belief there are not obvious differences.

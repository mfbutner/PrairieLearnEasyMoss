# My Algorithm (steps to solve the problem)

 
# **To find the solution/s or roots of quadratic equation**


# _A quadratic equation is of the form ax^2+bx+c, where a and b are the coeffcients of x^2 and x respectively, and c is a constant._

# **Coefficients**
1. Ask the user to input the value of a.
2. Ask the user to input the value of b.
3. Ask the user to input the value of c.

# **Finding the discriminant 'd'**
'd' is the discriminant which helps us figure out if the equation has no real roots, has one real root or has two distinct real roots.
d=b^2-2ac

# **Finding the type of roots the solution has using the discriminant**
1. If d is lesser than the value of zero, then the output is displayed as 'No real solution'.
2. If d is equal to zero, then the output is displayed as 'One real solution' along with the real solution which is given by '-b/2a'
3. If d is greater than zero then then output is displayed as 'Solution 1: and Solution 2:' with their respective distinct solutions.
Solution 1 is given by b-sqrt(d)/(2a) and solution 2 is given by (-b-sqrt(d))/(2a)

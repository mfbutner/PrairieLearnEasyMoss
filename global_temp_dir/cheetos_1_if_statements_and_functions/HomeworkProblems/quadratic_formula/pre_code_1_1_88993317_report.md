# My Algorithm (steps to solve the problem)
To begin solving the quadratic formula, you must be able to identify the values of a, b, and c.
Once you have those values, then you can begin to plug in the values to the given equation. 
When values have been properly plugged in, you can start the simplification process.
Finally, you can check the solutions.

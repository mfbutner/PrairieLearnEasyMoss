# Algorithm (steps to solve the problem)
1. Getting the Variables
2. Plugging in those set variables
3. Sinplifying the equation
4. Dinstinguish the different sceneraios that happen
    - This is something that was changed as before I did not take into account how different inputs can have different effects.
5. Catergorize which inputs create solutions
    - As stated previously, having different inputs lead to different solutions, or in some case, no solutions.

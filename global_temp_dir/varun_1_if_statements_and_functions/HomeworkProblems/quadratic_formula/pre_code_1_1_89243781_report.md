# My Quadratic Formula Algorithm


## Find Roots of Quadratic Formula
- Pick values to plug into the quadratic formula
- Determine how many real answers there will be
- Evaluate the formula

## Pick Values
- Determine 3 different numbers to use, a, b and c, providing ax^2 + bx + c as a reference
- a can never equal 0

## Evaluate the Formula
- Determine how many solutions there are
- If there are 0 solutions, stop here
- If there is 1 solution, divide negative b by 2 multiplied by a, or -b/(2a), to find the root and stop there
- Find the square root of 4 multiplied by a and c subtracted from b squared, or the square root of b^2 - 4ac
- Negate b and add the square root. Divide by 2 multiplied by a to get the first real root.
- Negate b and subtract the square root. Divide by 2 multiplied by a to get the second real root.

## Number of solutions
- If the value of b^2 - 4ac is negative, there are 0 real roots for the equation
- Take the square root of b^2 - 4ac
 	- If this value results in 0, there is one real root
 	- If this value does not result in 0, there are 2 real roots

## Results of Roots
- Record each result to two decimal places

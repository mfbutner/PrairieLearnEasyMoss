### How to Solve Quadratic Formula:
1. Express the equation in the form ax^2 + bx + c = 0, where x is the variable and
 a, b, c are constants.  
2. Check the discriminant to see if there are real solutions to x:  
(i.e.) if (b^2-4ac)<0 then no more steps need to be taken and there are no real solutions to x. Otherwise, we can continue to the next step.
3. Plug a, b, c into the quadratic formula to get the two solutions for x:  
(i.e.) x1=(-b + (b^2-4ac)^(1/2))/(2a), x2=(-b - (b^2-4ac)^(1/2))/(2a)  
3. if x1=x2 (because b^2-4ac=0) then there is only one real solution to x, which would be x=x1=x2, otherwise
there are  2 real solutions to x, would would be x=x1 and x2.

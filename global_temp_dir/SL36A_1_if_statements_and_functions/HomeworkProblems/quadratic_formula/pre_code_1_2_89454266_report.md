## Find solutions to the quadratic equation
1. Ask the User for values a, b, and c (a can't be 0) 
2. Find the discriminant
3. Calculate the roots
4. Tell the User if there were no real solutions, one real solution, or two real solutions
5. Tell the User the solution(s) is there was one real solution or two real solutions
## Find the discriminant
1. Calculate b^(2)-4ac
## Calculate the roots
### No real solutions
1. If the discriminant is negative
### One real solution
1. If the discriminant is zero
2. Solution is -b/2a
### Two real solutions
1. If the discriminant is positive
2. Solution 1 is (-b+sqrt(b^(2)-4ac))/2a
3. Solution 2 is (-b-sqrt(b^(2)-4ac))/2a

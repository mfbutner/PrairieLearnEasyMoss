It took me some time, perhaps even an hour, to get the quadratic formula to work correctly.
I was making silly mistakes, so I decided to take my time.

Once I got it to work, I tried to figure out how to get results similar to examples. I didn't
understand what to do with the "nan" result in example 2. I knew I had to use an if-else statement, but I
didn't know how.

So, as a simple-minded person, I used the "==" and ">" signs to make the if-else statement work.

I was making a lot of silly mistakes, such as forgetting to include "." or "s" or even a few words.

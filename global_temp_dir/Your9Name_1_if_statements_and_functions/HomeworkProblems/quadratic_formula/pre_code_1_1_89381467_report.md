My plan before starting to solve the problem was as follows:

Initially, I didn't understand how to approach the problem, so I decided to write down the information given
and create a function with multiple printf and scanf statements. Then, I was confused about what to do next,
so I went online and asked for an example of quadratic equation. I solved it using basic math on my own on a 
piece of paper.

After doing that I decided to write a code in the same way I solved the quadratic equation on the paper. I
went through the examples given in the prompt and tried to update my program as needed. I didn't plan anything
ahead of time and just went with the flow.

To check my progress quickly, I used an external online C compiler before making any big changes to my code in
my Visual Studio Code.

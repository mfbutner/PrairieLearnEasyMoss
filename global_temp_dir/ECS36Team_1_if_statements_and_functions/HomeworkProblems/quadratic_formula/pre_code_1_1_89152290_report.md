# HW 3.1: Quadratic Formula

## 1. Ask the user for a quadratic equation
1. Ask user for inputs for a, b, and c given a quadratic equation 
## 2. Solve the quadratic equation 
1. Check if there is a real solution (Check if the number inside the square root of the quadratic formula is negative)

2. If it is negative there are no real solutions

3. If the number is not negative there is one or two real solutions, calculate by plugging in user input to the following equations
        
        1. First calculate the (-b + (b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a
        2. Then calculate the (-b - (b^2 -4ac)) / 2a
##3. Print the result
a. If no answer 
        print tell the user that there is no real solution

b. If there are answers check if two answers are equal

        a.if two answers are equal give user back one of the answers
        b.if two answers are not equal give user back both two answers

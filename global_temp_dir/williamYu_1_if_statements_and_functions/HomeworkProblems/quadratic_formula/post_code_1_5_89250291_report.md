# Algorithm (steps to solve the problem)


## Solving The Quadratic Formula
1. Receive variables from the user
2. Determine how many solutions there are
3. Calculate solutions (if any)

##Receive Variables from the User
1. Prompt the user to enter an integer value for the "a" variable
2. Prompt the user to enter an integer value for the "b" variable
3. Prompt the user to enter an integer value for the "c" variable

##Determine How Many Solutions there are
1. Calculate the discriminant
2. If the discriminant is greater than 0, there will be 2 real solutions
3. If the discriminant is equal to 0, there will be 1 real solution
4. If the discriminant is less than 0, there will be no real solutions

##Calculate the solutions
1. If there is 2 real solutions
    1. Calculate the first solution by first adding the square root of the discriminant (of the quadratic formula)
    2. Calculate the second solution by subtracting the square root of the discriminant (of the quadratic formula)
2. If there is 1 real solution
    1. The discriminant is equal to 0 so it does not matter whether you add or subtract.  Calculate the rest of the quadratic formula
3. If there is no real solutions
    1. Print "No solutions"

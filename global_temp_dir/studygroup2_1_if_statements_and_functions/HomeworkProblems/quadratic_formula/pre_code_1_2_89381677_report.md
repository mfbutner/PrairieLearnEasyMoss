## Determine how many real roots there are

    
+   Use the discriminant to determine how many roots there are.
    
    1.According to the discriminant, we can get discriminant's result is bigger than 0.
    
    - There are two real roots.
    
    2.According to the discriminant, we can get discriminant's result is equal to 0.
    
    -   There is one real roots.
    
    3.According to the discriminant, we can get discriminant's result is less than 0.
    
    -   There are no real roots.

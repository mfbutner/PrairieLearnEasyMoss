# Algorithm (steps to solve the problem)
## Get your numbers
1. explain what form the equation is supposed to be in
2. get the number for A
3. get the number for B
4. get the number for C

## Solve the equation being square rooted
1. multiply values A and C
2. multiply the product by 4
3. multiply value B by itself
4. subtract the result from step 2 from the result of step 3

## Figure out number of real solutions
1. based on the answer of this part of the equation find out the number of real solutions 
    1. if greater than zero, then there are 2 real
    2. if less than zero, there are no real 
    3. if equal to zero, then there is 1 real solution

## Create the new numbers
1. Skip to the last section if the previous was less than zero
2. square root the answer
3. create 2 different numbers, 1 positive, 1 negative (unless answer was 0)

## Solve the equation(s)
1. create 1 equation if 0, otherwise create 2 equations (1 for each value)
2. for each equation
    1. add the number to the negative of the value of B
    2. divide the equation by 2 times the value of A

## Display the results
1. say how many real solutions to the problem there are
2. if there are more than 0 solutions, for every solution print them to the screen

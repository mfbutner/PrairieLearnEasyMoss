# My Algorithm (steps to solve the problem)
## Getting the value of a,b and c
    1. Ask for the value of a, b and c from user
    2. If the value of a is 0, ask for another value of a.
## Calculating the discriminant of function
    1. using the fromula of the discriminant(b2-4ac) to calculate the value of discriminant
    2. determining the number of the real solutions the function have.
        a. if the discriminant is greater than 0, there are 2 real solutions
        b. if the discriminant is equal to 0, there are 1 real solution
        c. if the discriminant is less than 0, there are no real solution
## Calculating the solution(s) of the function
    1. if there are no real solution, then tell the user there are no real solution.
    2. if there are 1 real solution, then just calculate the output by formula(-b/2a) and tell the output to user
    3. if there are 2 real solutiona, then  calculate the output by formula((-b+-[?](b2-4ac))/(2a)) and tell the output to user

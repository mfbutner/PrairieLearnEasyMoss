# Calculating the solutions for x using the quadratic formula
##Set up
1. get three numbers
2. set the first number = a, second = b, third = c
3. Split the quadratic formula into two parts, one using plus, and the otehr using minus
##Solve
1.check if b^2 - 4 * a * c is less than 0
    1. if true, there are no solutions
2.Otherwise plug a, b, and c into both positive and negative quadratic formulas
3.check if positive quadratic is the same as negative quadratic
    1. if true there is one solutions
    2. say the value from the positive quadratic
4. If previous checks are false
    1. There are two solutions
    2. say both positive quadratic and negative quadratic.

# Differences
1. Instead of explaining the basic arithmatic, I just plugged all the values into the quadratic formula
2. I removed the get solutions header
    1. no more skipping step when there is no solutions
    2. no longer tells the user to go through every check, but rather check is there are no solutions, then one solution, then two solutions.

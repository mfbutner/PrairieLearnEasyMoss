# Algorithm (steps to solve the problem)

# Differences
Our solution to finding the solution followed pretty similar to our plan. However we did make a mistake for when the discriminant resulted in 0, because x != -b/2. It should have been x = -b/(2*a). We fixed it in our codes once we noticed the outputs weren't matching to the actual values under that if statement section.

# My Algorithm (steps to solve the problem)
##Solving Quadratics
1. Set up the equation
2. Determine number of solutions if any
3. Solve using the quadratic formula

##Set up the equation
1. The problem should be in the equation form of ax^2 + bx + c = 0 
2. Using the form above,
3. Determine the values of a,b, and c 
4. Make note of these values as they will be plugged into another equation

##Determine number of solutions if any
1. Using the values of a,b, and c from the original equations, we can determine solutions or if there are no solutions using equations for the x
2. To first determine if there are real solutions to the equation we use these comparisons/discriminants
    a. If b^2 > 4ac, there are two real solutions for x
    b. If b^2 < 4ac, there are no real solutions for x
    c. If b^2 = 4ac, there is exactly one solution for x

##Solve using the quadratic formula
1. For b^2 > 4ac, we can solve for both x solutions using x = [ -b +- [?](b^2 - 4ac) ] / 2
2. Doing both equations will result in both of the solutions
3. For b^2 = 4ac, we can simply do x = -b / 2, because the discriminant is equal to 0
4. For b^2 < 4ac, there are no real solutions to the equation

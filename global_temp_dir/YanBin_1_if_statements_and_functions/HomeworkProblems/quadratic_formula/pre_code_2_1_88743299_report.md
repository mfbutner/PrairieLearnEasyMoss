# Start of Program
1. Ask for the a, b, c values of the quadratic equation
2. calculate the roots of the given quadratic equation
3. display the roots of the given quadratic equation

## Ask for the a, b, c values of the quadratic equation
1. Ask the user for the a, b, c values of the given quadratic equation in the form ax^2 + bx + c
and remember those values

## Calculate the roots of the given quadratic equation
1. solve for the expression inside the square root of the quadratic equation using the given values of a, b, c (skip steps 2 and 3 if that expression is negative)
2. calculate the + root of the given quadratic equation using + in the +/-
3. calculate the - root of the given quadratic equation using - in the +/-

## Display the roots of the given quadratic equation
1. if there are no roots (expression inside square root is negative), then display that there are no real roots
2. if the root obtained by using + is the same as the root obtained by using -, then display that there is one real solution and display that solution
3. otherwise (if steps 1 and 2 or false), there are two real solutions and display both solutions

### solve for the expression inside the square root
1. if the expression inside the square root is negative, then there cannot exist a real solution b/c there are no square roots of negative numbers on the real plane
2. if the expression is positive, continue on calculating the roots

### calculate the + root of the given quadratic equation using + in the +/-
1. evaluate the quadratic equation using the values of a, b, c and the + sign for the +/-

### calculate the - root of the given quadratic equation using - in the +/-
1. evaluate the quadratic equation using the values of a, b, c and the - sign for the +/-

# Algorithm (steps to solve the problem)

## Solve the quadratic equation
1. Get the quadratic equation
2. Determine the number of solutions
3. Provide the solution(s) (if any). 

## Get the quadratic equation
1. Provide the quadratic equation form ax^2 + b x + c.
2. Ask the user to enter a, b, c respectively. 

## Determine the number of solutions
Calculate b^2 - 4ac
1. If < 0, no solutions. End program.
2. If = 0, one solution
3. If > 0, two solutions

##Calculate the solution(s) (when exist)
Use the formula to calculate the first solution
2. If only one solution, provide the result.
2. If there exists two solutions, calculate the second solution and provide the result. 

# Differences

1. End the program when it's determined that there's no solutions. 
2. When solution(s) exist, calculate the first solution. 
3. Calculate the second solution only when a second solution exists.

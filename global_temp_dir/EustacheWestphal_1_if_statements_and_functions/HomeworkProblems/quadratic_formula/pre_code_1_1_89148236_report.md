#1. Get the input
1. Get the a, b, and c values from the user

#2. Do the Calculations
1. Plug the a, b, and c values into the quadratic formula
    1. If b squared - 4 times a times c is negative, there are no real answers
    2. Otherwise the answers are the two different options that the quadratic formula gives, or the one answer if both of the answers are the same

#3. Display the answers
1. If there are no real answers, say there are no real answers
2. If both of the answers are the same then say that there is only one real solution
3. If there are two different answers then say that there are two solutions, with the first one being the + solution of the quadratic formula

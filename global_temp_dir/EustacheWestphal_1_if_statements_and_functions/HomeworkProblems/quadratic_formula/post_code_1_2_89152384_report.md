#Overview
1. Get the a b and c values of the quadratic equation
2. Calculate the solutions using those values and show the solutions, if there are any

#1. Get the a, b and c values
1. ask for the a, b and c values

#2. Calculate the solutions and show them
1. Plug the values into the quadratic formula
    1. If b squared minus four times a times c (the part in the square root) is negative, say that there are no solutions (because you cant take the square root of a negative)
    2. If the part in the square root is not negative then calculate the 2 possible solutions using the quadratic formula
        1. If those two solutions are the same then say there is one solution
        2. If those two solutions are different than say there are two solutions with the first one being the -b + bla bla solution
#Changes
I put the showing the results and calculating the results part into one section because it was a lot easier that way and felt more streamlined.

# Algorithm (steps to solve the problem)

# My Algorithm (steps to solve the problem)
# Solve the function


# Test 4ab
##1.Create an equation that can test several roots
##2.Test how many roots this formula has
##3.There are several answers to the corresponding situation

#If 4ab <0
##1.There are no real solution

#If 4ab =0
##1.There There is one real solution
##2.Print the answer

#If 4ab =0
##1.There are 2 real solutions
##2.Print 2 answers

#Use the function
##1.Enter three numeric values
##2.Use the test of 4ab to get answer

# Differences
There were no differences between my original and current solutions

# Algorithm (steps to solve the problem)
## Solve a Quadratic Equation
  1. Get the a value of the equation
  2. Get the b value of the equation
  3. Get the c value of the equation
  4. Get the roots using the quadratic formula

## Get the roots using the quadratic formula
 1. Determine how many solutions there are
 2. Calculate the solutions if there are any
  1. If there are no solutions, say there are no solutions
  2. If there is one solution, say the solution
  3. If there are two solutions, say the largest solution then the smallest solution

## Determine how many solutions there are
  1. If the square of b minus the product of 4, a, and c is less than one
    1. There are no solutions
  2. If the square of b minus the product of 4, a, and c is equal to 0
    1. There is one solution
  3. Otherwise
    1. There are two solutions

## Calculate the solutions if there are any
  1. If there is one solution
    1. The root is negative b divided by the product of 2 and a
  2. If there are two solutions
    1. The first root is negative b plus the squareroot of the differene of b squared minus the product of 4, a, and c, all of which is divided by the product of 2 and a
    2. The second root is negative b minus the squareroot of the differene of b squared minus the product of 4, a, and c, all of which is divided by the product of 2 and a

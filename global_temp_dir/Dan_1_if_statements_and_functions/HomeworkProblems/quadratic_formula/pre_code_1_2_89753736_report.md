# My Algorithm (steps to solve the problem)

1.) Get user input   
2.) Determine number of solutions    
3.) Solve for solutions  
4.) Communicate the results  

##Get  user input:
1.) Ask user for a  
2.) Ask user for b  
3.) Ask user for c  

##Determine number of solutions:
1.) Solve for discriminant  
-when the discriminant is negative the number of solutions is 0  
-when the discriminant is equal to 0 the number of solutions is 1  
-when the discriminant is positive the number of solutions is 2  

##Solve for solutions:  
-When the number of solutions is zero there are no real solutions  
-When the number of solutions is 1 then solve for -b / 2a to get the solution  
-When the number of solutions is 2 then solve for (-b +- sqrt(b^2-4ac)) / 2a

##Communicate the results to the user:  
-tell the user the number of solutions and what those solutions are

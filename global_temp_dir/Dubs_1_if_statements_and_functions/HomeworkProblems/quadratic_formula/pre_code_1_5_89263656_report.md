# My Algorithm (steps to solve the problem)
1)First Get Values 

2)Put the value through formula 

3)tell the answer to the user
##1 First Get Values
ask the user for the 3 values needed for the formula
##2 Put the value through formula 
Take the values and use the math formula to find a solution

2A) Addition solution

2B) Negative solution

##2A Addition Solution
Put it through the formula and check whether it has to take the square root of a negative value.  
2A 1) Has Negative square root

2A 2) Doesn't have negative square root
## 2A 1 Has Negative square root
it is not the solution
## 2A 2 Doesn't have negative square root
Then the final value is the solution
##2B Negative Solution
Put it through the formula and check whether it has to take the square root of a negative value.  
2B 1) Has Negative square root

2B 2) Doesn't have negative square root
##2B 1 Has Negative square root
it is not the solution
##2B 2 Doesn't have negative square root
Then the final value is the solution

##3) tell the answer to the user
1) Has one Final solution

2) has two Final solutions

3) Has zero Final solutions
##3A Has one Final solution
tell the user the right one 
##3B has two Final solutions
tell the user the two right ones
##3C Has zero Final solutions
tell the user it has no answer

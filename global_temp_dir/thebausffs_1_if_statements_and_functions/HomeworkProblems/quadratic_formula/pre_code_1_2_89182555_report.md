## **Set up the Problem for the equation $ y = ax^2 + bx + c $**
1. Ask for a number value for a
2. Ask for a number value for b
3. Ask for a number value for c

## **Solve the Problem**
1. *Find the number of real solutions*
2. *Calculate the real solutions*

## **Show the Answer**
1. *Show how many real solutions there are*
2. *Show the real solutions*

## *Find the number of real solutions*
1. Calculate the discriminant from the equation: $ D = b^2 - 4ac $
2. Determine how many real solutions there are based on if the discriminant is positive, zero, or negative

## *Calculate the real solutions*
1. If the discriminant is positive, use the quadratic formula and plug in the given a, b, and c: 
$ x = {-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac} \over 2a} $
2. If the discriminant is zero, use the shortened quadratic formula: $ x = {-b \over 2a} $

## *Show how many real solutions there are*
* If the discriminant is positive, there are 2 real solutions
* If the discriminant is zero, there is 1 real solution
* If the discriminant is negative, there are 0 real solutions

## *Show the real solutions*
* If the discriminant is positive, show the larger solution first, then the second solution
* If the discriminant is zero, show the solution
* If the discriminant is negative, don't show anything because there is no real solution

# Algorithm (steps to solve the problem)

## Values of a, b, and c
- Get values of a, b, and c from the user

## Determine Solutions using Delta
1) Plug in all values of a, b, and c into the quadratic formula

2) Two solutions if delta is a positive number (create two fractions, one with the positive values of the square root of delta and the other with the negative value of the square root of delta and evaluate)

3) One solutioon if delta is zero (Evaluate using only one fraction)

4) No solutions if delta is a negative number (If this is true, then no other work has to be done)
# Differences
1) In the original plan I talked about doing cases for whether or not each of the values inputed were of none integer types, however in the prompt it stated that a will never be equal to zero so I ended up just making all my variables doubles

2) I ended up not breaking up the fraction into the numerator and the denominator since a could never be zero (Which was the only reason why I was going to break up the fraction in the first place)

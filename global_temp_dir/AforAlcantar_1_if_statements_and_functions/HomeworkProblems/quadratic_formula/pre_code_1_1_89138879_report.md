# My Algorithm (steps to solve the problem)

## Values of a, b , and c
- Determine whether each is positive, negative, or even zero
- Some values might be decimal numbers or fractions
## Breaking Formula Up
#####1.  Numerator 
- -b +/- square root of b^2 - 4ac

#####2.  Denominator
- 2a

## Determine Solutions using Delta 
####(value under square root) 
1) Plug in all values of a, b, and c into the quadratic formula

2)Two solutions if delta is a positive number (create two fractions, one with the positive value of the square root of delta and the other with the negative value of the square root of delta and evaluate)

3)  One solution if delta is zero (Evaluate using only one fraction)

4) No solutions if delta is a negative number (If this is true, then no other work has to be done)

# My Algorithm (steps to solve the problem)

## Finding Real Roots of X
1. Set up expression
2. Check how many solutions there are, if there is one or more, proceed
3. Solve for root(s)

## Set Up Equation
1. Start with an equation in the form ax^2 + bx + c
2. Plug in the given values for a, b, and c

## Check for number of solutions
1. Square b
2. Mulitply 4 by a and c
3. Subtract sum from the last step (step 2) from the square of b
4. If this number is less than zero, there are no solutions and you are done
5. If this number is zero, there is one solution, and you should proceed with the calculation
6. If this number is greater than zero, there are two solutions, and you should proceed with the calculation

## Solve for root(s)
1. Set up the quadratic equation
2. Plug in the given values for a, b, and c
3. Solve

## Solve
1. Multiply value b by -1 to get -b
2. Find the value inside the radical by first squaring b and then subtracting the sum of 4 times a times c from it
3. Square root the value
4. Add -b to your square rooted value from the last step
5. Divide your answer from the last step by 2 times a to get the larger of the two roots
6. Repeat steps 4 and 5, but this time instead of adding your square rooted value to -b, subtract it. This will give us the smaller of the two roots.
7. If these two roots are the same, the equation only has one root

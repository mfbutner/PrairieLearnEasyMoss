# My Algorithm (steps to solve the problem)
First of all, I need to define a, b, c in the form of double and print them out. Next, propose"Please enter a, b, c" to those who use the program. Next, continue to define solution1, solution2, and solution3 in the form of doube. Next, analyze the equation given above. The denominator in the equation cannot be 0, so 2a cannot be equal to 0, that is, a cannot be equal to 0. And the value in the root sign cannot be less than 0. Then use if and else if statements to distinguish different situations that occur so as to print different results. Finally, return 0.

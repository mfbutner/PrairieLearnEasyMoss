# My Algorithm (steps to solve the problem)
## Get the input
1. write the statment of "Given a quadratic equation of the form a*x^2 + b * x + c"
2. get the input of a, b,c

## Consider about the different conditions of the quadratic equation(square root value)
1. b*b - 4*a*c>0 (2 results)
2. b*b - 4*a*c<0 (no result)
3. b*b - 4*a*c = 0 (1 result)

## Calculate the solution according to the quadratic equation and show the output

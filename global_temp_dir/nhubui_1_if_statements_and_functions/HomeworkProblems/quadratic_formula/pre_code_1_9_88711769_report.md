#Solve the quadratic equation
1. Set up the quadratic equation
2. Find the roots of the equation
3. Show the result

##Set up the quadratic formula
1. Ask the user for a, b, c for the quadratic equation in the form $ax^2 + bx + c$
2. Plug the user's input into the equation

##Find the roots of the equation
1. Plug a, b, c into the quadratic formula ($x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$) and reduce the equation to the simplest form
##Show the result
1. If there is only one real solution calculated
    - Say that there is only one real solution and show the result
2. If there are 2 real solutions calculated
    - Say that there are 2 real solutions and show the result
3. Otherwise, if there are no real solution
    - Say that there is no real solution

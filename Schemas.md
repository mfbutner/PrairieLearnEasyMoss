## Goals
- Create an easy to use wrapper for running MOSS on assignments downloanded from Prairie Learn
- Instructors should only have to write a configuration file for an assignment **once** and be able to reuse it
  without change as long as the assignment itself does not change

## Terms
- Assignment: The top level. A collection of one or more questions.
- Question: A collection of one or more Problems
- Problem: An individual element in the Prairie Learn system that a student submits an answer for

## Structure Of Assignments Downloaded From Prairie Learn
- AssignmentName/StudentIDOrTeamName_TopLevelQuestionPath/QuestionPath/Submissions

Each submission has the following naming conventions
- ProblemName_VariantNumber_AttemptNumber_SubmissionID_fileName
  - VariantNumber is regenerated each time a new variant of the problem is generaged
  - Each Variant of a question allows 1 or more attempts on that specific Variant. The Attempt number is the number of
    the attempt of that variant (1, 2, 3, ...).

Example: QuadraticFormula_3_7_111_quad.c would correspond to the student's 7th attempt on the 3rd variant of the 
Quadratic Formula problem and the file they submitted was named quad.c. 

## Configuration Schema
Question Required means that the value can appear at the global level
as a default for all problem but can be overriden within a particular problem.
This value if not specified as a default, must be provided within a Problem.
